# Graph Compilation Strategies Research

This document summarizes a short research spike evaluating dynamic graph execution versus ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation for the orchestration engine.

## Proof-of-Concept Benchmark

A small benchmark was implemented in `benchmarks/graph_compilation.py`. It builds a simple five-node graph and measures runtime and memory usage for two approaches:

1. **Dynamic build** – a new graph is constructed and executed for every iteration.
2. **Compiled reuse** – a graph is compiled once and reused across iterations.

The benchmark was executed with 100 iterations using Python 3.12. Results:

```
Dynamic build+run: 5.4072s, peak 578929 bytes
Compiled run: 1.6196s, peak 1992695 bytes
```

AOT reuse significantly reduced total runtime but consumed more peak memory due to the compiled graph object.

## Recommendation

A hybrid approach is advised:

- **Compile** well-defined subgraphs that run frequently or contain expensive logic.
- **Keep** the top-level orchestration dynamic so new tasks can modify graph structure at runtime.

This balances latency with flexibility and avoids unnecessary memory overhead for rarely used paths.
