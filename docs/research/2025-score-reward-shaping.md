# **A Proposal for SCoRe-Inspired Reward Shaping to Incentivize Meaningful Self-Correction in RLAIF**

## **Section 1: Foundational Framework: Self-Correction within the RLAIF Loop**

### **1.1. The RLAIF Training Paradigm: Mechanics and Objectives**

To effectively teach Large Language Models (LLMs) the nuanced skill of self-correction, it is imperative to first establish the training paradigm within which this learning will occur. Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) has emerged as a powerful and scalable method for aligning LLMs with desired behaviors, moving beyond the limitations of purely supervised approaches.1 The RLAIF process serves as the foundational loop for our proposed intervention.

The standard RLAIF pipeline consists of a well-defined, multi-stage process. It typically begins with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), where a pre-trained base model is adapted to a specific domain or style using a dataset of high-quality demonstrations.1 This initial step provides a strong baseline policy. The core innovation of RLAIF lies in the subsequent stages, which replace the costly and time-consuming process of gathering human preference labels with feedback from a capable AI model, often referred to as the preference or critic model.4

The mechanics of the AI feedback stage proceed as follows: for a given prompt, the SFT model (or the policy model at a given stage of training) generates two or more responses. These responses are then presented to a separate, often more powerful, AI labeler (e.g., GPT-4 used as a critic for a GPT-3.5-level policy model).1 This labeler evaluates the responses based on a predefined set of principles or a "constitution," which can encode complex preferences for qualities like helpfulness, harmlessness, and factual accuracy.6 The AI labeler's output is a preference judgment, indicating which response is superior. This process is repeated across a large dataset of prompts to generate a substantial corpus of AI-labeled preference pairs.2

This preference data is then used to train a Reward Model (RM), also known as a Preference Model (PM). The PM learns to predict the preference score that the AI labeler would assign to any given (prompt, response) pair. The output of this PM is a scalar value, which serves as the reward signal for the final stage: reinforcement learning.7

In this final stage, the SFT model is further fine-tuned using an RL algorithm, most commonly Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).3 The PPO algorithm uses the scalar reward from the PM to update the policy model's parameters. A critical component of PPO in this context is the inclusion of a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence penalty. This penalty term regularizes the update step, ensuring that the policy model does not deviate too drastically from the original SFT model, which helps maintain training stability and prevents the model from "forgetting" its foundational capabilities in pursuit of maximizing the reward signal.3 This entire pipeline—SFT, PM training, and PPO-based RL—constitutes the RLAIF framework into which our self-correction reward function will be integrated.

### **1.2. The Self-Correction Gap in Standard RLAIF**

While the RLAIF paradigm is highly effective for general alignment, it is fundamentally insufficient for cultivating the specific and valuable skill of *meaningful self-correction*. The standard RLAIF reward signal is typically a holistic measure of a response's quality, such as its helpfulness or harmlessness.10 This creates a critical gap: the reward model does not explicitly distinguish between a response that was correct on the first attempt and a response that became correct only after a substantive revision. Both scenarios can yield a high final reward, providing no specific incentive for the model to learn the

*process* of correction itself.

This leads to a significant vulnerability in the learning process. The RL agent, driven to maximize its reward, may learn to perform trivial edits. For example, it might make minor rephrasings, fix a grammatical error, or slightly alter the formatting of an initially incorrect response. If these superficial changes are enough to nudge the PM score upwards, the model will be rewarded without having engaged in the desired behavior of fixing a genuine factual or logical flaw. This behavior is a form of **reward hacking**, where the agent discovers a low-effort strategy to exploit the reward function without fulfilling the intended, more complex task.11 The agent learns to "game the system" rather than acquiring the robust skill of error identification and correction.

Furthermore, the standard RLAIF setup creates an implicit bias *against* the very process it needs to encourage. A multi-turn self-correction loop is inherently more computationally expensive—in terms of tokens generated, latency, and energy consumption—than producing a single response. An RL agent optimizing for cumulative reward within a resource-constrained environment will naturally favor the most efficient path to that reward. If a good first response and a good second (corrected) response receive the same reward, the single-turn strategy is unequivocally superior from the agent's perspective. The system, by its very design, incentivizes the model to avoid the correction loop entirely. This dynamic actively suppresses the exploration and learning required to master self-correction. Therefore, a successful intervention must not only add a positive incentive for correction but also explicitly counteract this inherent, efficiency-driven penalty.

### **1.3. The Multi-Turn Interaction Model for Self-Correction**

To properly formulate a reward function that targets the act of correction, we must first define the structure of the interaction. The self-correction process is modeled as a multi-turn interaction between the agent and its environment (which, in this case, includes the critic or a self-correction prompt). The fundamental unit of experience, or trajectory, that our reward function will evaluate is a two-turn sequence 13:

1. **Initial Attempt:** Given an initial state (prompt), the model π generates a first response, output\_1.  
2. **Correction Trigger:** The model then receives a critique or a generic instruction to self-correct (e.g., "Please review your previous response for errors and provide a corrected version.").  
3. **Revised Attempt:** The model processes this trigger and generates a second, revised response, output\_2.

The complete trajectory for a single self-correction episode is thus represented as the tuple: (prompt, output\_1, critique, output\_2). Our proposed reward function will be computed at the end of this trajectory, taking into account the properties of both output\_1 and output\_2 to generate a single, comprehensive reward signal for the PPO update.

## **Section 2: A Deep Analysis of the SCoRe Framework**

The recently proposed SCoRe (Self-Correction via Reinforcement Learning) framework provides the central inspiration for our work. It offers a robust and effective methodology for teaching LLMs to self-correct using entirely self-generated data, presenting a significant advance over previous methods that relied on external supervision or more powerful teacher models.13

### **2.1. Core Methodology: Self-Correction via Online RL**

SCoRe is a multi-turn, online reinforcement learning approach designed to significantly enhance an LLM's intrinsic self-correction capability.13 The "online" nature is critical; unlike methods that rely on static, offline datasets of corrections, SCoRe trains the model on its

*own* distribution of self-generated correction traces. This directly addresses the distribution mismatch problem, where a model trained on one set of errors may not be effective at correcting the different kinds of errors it produces itself.13

A key feature of the SCoRe framework is its self-contained nature. It trains a single model that is responsible for both generating the initial response and performing the subsequent correction.13 This eliminates the need for a separate, more capable teacher model to provide correction examples or oracle feedback, making it a more scalable and philosophically aligned approach for creating self-improving systems. The framework has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, achieving absolute gains of 15.6% on the MATH benchmark and 9.1% on HumanEval with Gemini models.13

### **2.2. Mitigating Behavioral Collapse with Two-Stage Training**

A primary challenge in training for self-correction, particularly with supervised methods, is the phenomenon of **behavior collapse**. This occurs when the model, in its attempt to optimize for reward, converges on a degenerate strategy of making only minor, superficial edits that are ineffective at fixing substantive errors.13 SCoRe directly confronts this failure mode through a carefully designed two-stage training process that acts as a form of regularization or curriculum learning.18

* **Stage 1: Policy Initialization.** The first stage aims to produce a policy initialization that is less susceptible to collapse. SCoRe achieves this by running multi-turn RL with a specific objective: training the model to correct *second-attempt* responses. During this phase, the distribution of the first-turn responses is constrained via a KL penalty to remain close to that of the original base model. This process effectively stabilizes the model's initial response generation while gently introducing the concept of correction, resulting in a policy that is primed for more effective learning in the next stage.13  
* **Stage 2: Amplifying Self-Correction.** In the second stage, the model initialized in Stage 1 is fine-tuned with multi-turn RL on both first- and second-turn corrections. Crucially, this stage employs a reward shaping bonus designed to specifically amplify genuine self-correction behavior. This two-stage approach ensures that the model first learns a stable foundation before being pushed to aggressively optimize for high-value corrections, thereby avoiding the common pitfall of collapsing into a trivial editing strategy.13 This structured curriculum is a key methodological insight that should inform the deployment of any complex reward function, including our own.

### **2.3. The "Progress over Perfection" Reward Principle**

The most significant conceptual contribution of the SCoRe framework is its reward principle, which can be summarized as rewarding **"progress over perfection"**.13 Instead of solely evaluating the quality of the final response (

output\_2), SCoRe's reward function explicitly rewards the *transition* from an incorrect state to a correct one.

For example, in a mathematical reasoning task, if the model's first attempt (output\_1) is incorrect, and its second attempt (output\_2) is correct, it receives a substantial reward bonus. If the first attempt was already correct, or if the second attempt remains incorrect, this bonus is not awarded. This is exemplified in the SCoRe paper where a model incorrectly calculates (7k \+ 4)(7k \+ 6)(7k \+ 8\) ≡ 192 (mod 7\) ≡ 1 (mod 7\) in its first turn, but correctly revises it to ≡ 24 (mod 7\) ≡ 3 (mod 7\) in the second turn.13 The reward is tied directly to this

fail \-\> pass transition.

This approach isolates the learning signal, focusing the full pressure of the RL update on the specific skill of fixing a mistake. It elegantly defines what a valuable correction is: one that changes the outcome from wrong to right. However, this definition, while powerful, is binary and coarse. It does not differentiate between a simple arithmetic fix and a complex logical overhaul, so long as both result in a 'pass'. This observation presents a clear opportunity for refinement. By replacing this binary check with a more nuanced, continuous measure of both correctness and the semantic significance of the edit, we can create a more sophisticated and targeted reward signal. SCoRe provides the foundational principle; our proposal seeks to build upon it by adding granularity and depth.

## **Section 3: Quantifying Meaningful Edits: A Prerequisite for Targeted Rewards**

To construct a reward function that incentivizes meaningful self-correction, we must first be able to quantitatively distinguish meaningful edits from trivial ones. This requires a precise taxonomy of edit types and a robust set of metrics capable of capturing semantic change.

### **3.1. A Taxonomy of Textual Edits**

For the purpose of this proposal, we define a practical, two-category taxonomy of textual edits:

* **Trivial Edits:** These are modifications that do not alter the core semantic content, factual claims, or logical structure of the response. While they may improve readability or style, they do not represent the kind of substantive correction we aim to incentivize. This category includes:  
  * **Rephrasing and Synonym Swapping:** Changing wording without altering meaning (e.g., "The movie was great" vs. "The film was excellent").  
  * **Grammatical and Typographical Corrections:** Fixing spelling, punctuation, or syntax.  
  * **Formatting Changes:** Adjusting layout, markdown, or presentation.  
* **Meaningful Edits:** These are modifications that fundamentally alter the informational content of the response. These are the high-value corrections that our reward function must target. This category includes:  
  * **Factual Correction:** Changing an incorrect fact to a correct one (e.g., "The capital of Australia is Sydney" \-\> "The capital of Australia is Canberra").  
  * **Logical Correction:** Fixing a flaw in a reasoning chain or argument.  
  * **Procedural Correction:** Altering a step in a set of instructions or a code block to make it functional or correct.  
  * **Addition/Removal of Critical Information:** Adding a crucial missing detail or removing an irrelevant or incorrect one that impacts the overall conclusion.

### **3.2. Beyond N-Gram Overlap: Advanced Semantic Similarity Metrics**

Traditional text similarity metrics based on n-gram overlap, such as ROUGE and BLEU, are inadequate for our purpose. They are designed to measure surface-level lexical similarity and are incapable of distinguishing between a valid paraphrase (a trivial edit) and a significant semantic shift (a meaningful edit).19 A meaningful correction might involve changing only a single word (e.g., "not"), resulting in a high n-gram overlap but a complete reversal of meaning. Therefore, we must turn to modern, embedding-based metrics that capture the semantic essence of the text.

Several advanced metrics are available:

* **BERTScore:** This metric moves beyond simple word overlap by computing the pairwise cosine similarity between the contextualized token embeddings of two texts, typically from a BERT-style model. It can be enhanced with inverse document frequency (IDF) weighting to give more importance to rare, informative words, providing a robust measure of semantic similarity that correlates well with human judgment.21  
* **Sentence-BERT (S-BERT):** This is an adaptation of transformer models specifically fine-tuned to produce semantically meaningful embeddings for entire sentences or short texts. By representing each text as a single vector in a high-dimensional space, the semantic similarity can be computed with a single, highly efficient cosine similarity calculation. This makes it ideal for tasks requiring large-scale text comparison.22  
* **STSScore (Direct Regression):** This approach uses a model, such as RoBERTa, that has been fine-tuned as a regression model directly on Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmark datasets. Instead of inferring similarity from embedding distance, it directly predicts a similarity score. This method has been shown to align very closely with human annotations of similarity.22  
* **Compression-based Edit Distance:** A novel and intriguing approach measures the informational difference between two texts using compression algorithms like Lempel-Ziv-77 (LZ77). The underlying principle is that the amount of new information required to compress the second text, given the first, is proportional to the edit distance. This metric has shown a high correlation with the actual time and effort expended by human editors.20

### **3.3. Proposed Metric for Meaningful Change: A Hybrid Approach**

No single metric is perfect; each involves trade-offs between accuracy, computational cost, and implementation complexity. For our reward function's "meaningfulness" component, we require a metric that is both semantically robust and computationally tractable enough to be used in a high-throughput RL training loop.

We propose using the **Cosine Distance derived from S-BERT embeddings**. This is calculated as 1 \- CosineSimilarity(embedding\_1, embedding\_2). A value near 0 indicates high similarity (a trivial edit), while a value approaching 1 (or 2, depending on the embedding space) indicates high dissimilarity (a meaningful edit).

**Justification:** S-BERT is explicitly designed for sentence-level semantic comparison and is computationally very efficient once the embeddings are generated.23 This makes it a pragmatic choice for an RL loop. While STSScore might offer slightly better alignment with human judgments, it necessitates training and maintaining a separate, fine-tuned regression model, which adds significant complexity to the pipeline.22 BERTScore is powerful but its pairwise token comparison is more computationally intensive than S-BERT's sentence-level comparison. The compression-based metric is a promising area for future research but is less established than embedding-based methods for this specific application. S-BERT offers the best balance of performance, speed, and ease of implementation for an initial proposal.

To formalize this decision, the following table provides a comparative analysis of the considered metrics.

| Metric | Underlying Principle | Pros | Cons | Suitability for M\_semantic |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **ROUGE/BLEU** | N-gram Overlap | Fast, simple to implement. | Fails to capture semantics; penalizes valid paraphrasing. | Low. |
| **BERTScore** | Token-level embedding similarity | High correlation with human judgment, robust to word order. | Computationally more intensive than sentence-level methods. | Medium-High. |
| **S-BERT Cosine Distance** | Sentence-level embedding distance | Very fast for pairwise comparison, captures sentence semantics well. | May not be as nuanced as token-level or direct prediction models. | **High (Proposed)**. |
| **STSScore** | Direct similarity prediction (regression) | Best alignment with human STS benchmarks. | Requires a dedicated fine-tuned model; potential for bias from its training data. | High (Alternative). |
| **LZ77 Edit Distance** | Compression-based informational difference | Captures complex substring edits, linear time complexity. | Newer approach, less established for this specific use case. | Medium (Future Work). |

## **Section 4: A Mathematically Defined Reward Function for Self-Correction**

Building on the principles from SCoRe and the metrics for quantifying edits, we now propose a specific, mathematically defined reward function. This function is designed as a composite signal, integrating multiple objectives to guide the LLM towards not just correct, but also meaningful and efficient self-correction.

### **4.1. High-Level Architecture: A Multi-Objective Composite Signal**

A monolithic reward function is often brittle and difficult to debug. Instead, our proposed reward function, R\_total, is a modular, multi-objective signal composed of four distinct components. This design is inspired by work in multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL), which recognizes that complex behaviors often arise from balancing competing goals.25 By decomposing the reward, we gain interpretability and the ability to fine-tune the learning dynamics by adjusting the weights of each component. The total reward is calculated at the end of the two-turn trajectory

(prompt, output\_1, critique, output\_2).

### **4.2. Component 1: The Base Preference Reward (Rbase​)**

* Mathematical Formulation:  
  Rbase​=PM(prompt,output2​)  
* **Description:** This component is the standard reward signal provided by the pre-existing RLAIF preference model (PM). It serves as the foundation of our reward system, providing a global measure of the overall quality of the *final, corrected response*.2 The PM is trained to capture general desirable attributes such as helpfulness, harmlessness, coherence, and factual accuracy. Including  
  R\_base ensures that the model's primary objective remains aligned with producing high-quality outputs, preventing it from optimizing for correction at the expense of final answer quality.

### **4.3. Component 2: The Correction Progress Bonus (Rprogress​)**

* Mathematical Formulation:  
  Rprogress​=β⋅I(PM(prompt,outputpass∧PM(prompt,outputfail)  
* **Description:** This component is the direct implementation of the "progress over perfection" principle from the SCoRe framework.13 It provides a large, discrete reward bonus,  
  β, if and only if the model successfully transitions from a "fail" state to a "pass" state.  
  * The term \\mathbb{I}(...) represents the indicator function, which evaluates to 1 if the condition inside is true, and 0 otherwise.  
  * τ\_{pass} and τ\_{fail} are scalar thresholds applied to the PM score. These are critical hyperparameters that define what constitutes a "passing" or "failing" response. For instance, τ\_{fail} could be set to a PM score of 0.2 and τ\_{pass} to 0.8 on a normalized 0-1 scale.  
  * This bonus creates a strong and highly targeted learning signal that is exclusively active when a genuine, successful correction occurs. It directly incentivizes the agent to learn policies that can transform incorrect outputs into correct ones.

### **4.4. Component 3: The Meaningfulness Multiplier (Msemantic​)**

* Mathematical Formulation:  
  Msemantic​=clip(α⋅(1−Ssbert​(output1​,output2​)),0,1)  
* **Description:** This component addresses the coarseness of the binary R\_progress bonus. It acts as a multiplier, scaling the progress bonus based on the semantic magnitude of the edit. This ensures that the largest rewards are reserved for corrections that are not only successful but also substantial.  
  * S\_{sbert}(\\text{output}\_1, \\text{output}\_2) is the cosine similarity between the S-BERT embeddings of the initial and revised responses.22  
  * 1 \- S\_{sbert}(...) computes the cosine distance, a value that is low for trivial edits (high similarity) and high for significant semantic changes (low similarity).  
  * α is a scaling hyperparameter that modulates the sensitivity of the multiplier.  
  * The clip(...) function constrains the multiplier's value to the range \`\`, which enhances training stability by preventing extreme reward values. A trivial edit will result in an M\_{semantic} value close to 0, effectively nullifying the progress bonus, while a major rewrite that corrects the answer will result in a value close to 1, delivering the full bonus.

### **4.5. Component 4: The Efficiency Cost (Ceff​)**

* Mathematical Formulation:  
  $$C\_{eff} \= \\lambda \\cdot \\text{num\_tokens}(\\text{output}\_2)$$  
* **Description:** This component introduces a direct penalty for verbosity, addressing the implicit bias against the costly nature of the correction loop. By penalizing the length of the final response, we create a more realistic optimization landscape where the agent must balance correctness and meaningfulness with conciseness.  
  * \\lambda is a small, positive weight that controls the magnitude of the cost penalty. It must be carefully tuned to discourage unnecessary verbosity without stifling necessary elaboration.  
  * This term incentivizes the model to find the most efficient correction, promoting clarity and reducing computational overhead during inference.

## **Section 5: Multi-Objective Integration via Reward Scalarization**

The proposed reward function is composed of multiple, distinct objectives. Integrating these components into a single scalar reward for the RL agent is a non-trivial task that requires navigating the inherent tensions between them. This is a problem of multi-objective optimization, and the method chosen for combining the components, known as scalarization, has significant implications for the final learned policy.

### **5.1. The Challenge of Conflicting Objectives**

The components of our proposed reward function are not always in alignment; they represent potentially conflicting goals that the agent must learn to balance.28 For example:

* **Progress vs. Quality:** An agent might maximize the R\_{progress} \\cdot M\_{semantic} term by making a large, radical edit that successfully corrects a factual error but introduces stylistic awkwardness or minor inaccuracies, thereby lowering the R\_{base} score.  
* **Completeness vs. Conciseness:** An agent might generate a very detailed and comprehensive output\_2 to maximize R\_{base}, but this verbosity would be penalized by the efficiency cost C\_{eff}.  
* **Safety vs. Risk:** The safest strategy to maximize R\_{base} might be to make very conservative, minor edits. However, this would result in a low M\_{semantic} score, preventing the agent from receiving the large rewards associated with bold, meaningful corrections.

Navigating these trade-offs is the central challenge of multi-objective reinforcement learning. The scalarization function determines how these trade-offs are resolved.

### **5.2. Analysis of Scalarization Techniques**

Scalarization is the process of converting a reward vector (r\_1, r\_2,..., r\_n) into a single scalar value that can be used by a standard RL algorithm.31 Two primary families of scalarization techniques are relevant here.

* **Linear Scalarization (Weighted Sum):** This is the most common and straightforward approach. The total reward is calculated as a weighted linear combination of the individual objective rewards: R\_total \= w\_1\*r\_1 \+ w\_2\*r\_2 \+... \+ w\_n\*r\_n. This method is simple to implement, and the weights w\_i are highly interpretable as direct indicators of the relative importance of each objective.33 The primary drawback of linear scalarization is its theoretical limitation: it is only guaranteed to find optimal policies that lie on the  
  *convex* portions of the Pareto front—the set of all optimal trade-off solutions.31 It may fail to discover valuable policies that exist in non-convex regions of the solution space.  
* **Non-Linear Scalarization (e.g., Chebyshev):** To address the limitations of linear methods, non-linear scalarization functions have been developed. The **Chebyshev scalarization** is a prominent example. It is formulated as SQ(s, a) \= max\_o { w\_o \\cdot |Q(s, a, o) \- z^\*\_o| }, where z\* is an ideal "utopian" reward vector that represents the best possible outcome for each objective.31 By minimizing the maximum weighted distance to this utopian point, the Chebyshev method can discover optimal policies in both convex and non-convex regions of the Pareto front. This suggests it could potentially find more nuanced or qualitatively different policies than a simple weighted sum. The choice to use a non-linear method reflects a belief that the optimal policy space may contain such complex, non-linear trade-offs—for instance, a strategy that excels at high-impact factual corrections might exist in a "nook" of the policy space that is inaccessible via linear trade-offs.

### **5.3. Proposed Scalarization Formula: A Pragmatic Weighted Sum**

Despite the theoretical advantages of non-linear methods, we propose to begin with a **weighted linear sum** for our initial implementation. This decision is rooted in pragmatism: it is significantly simpler to implement, debug, and analyze. The weights in a linear sum have a direct and intuitive interpretation as trade-off parameters, which is invaluable during the initial phases of research and development.

The final proposed reward function is therefore formulated as:

Rtotal​=wbase​⋅Rbase​+wprogress​⋅(Rprogress​⋅Msemantic​)−wcost​⋅Ceff​  
Substituting the definitions from Section 4, we get:

$$R\_{total} \= w\_{base} \\cdot PM(\\text{prompt}, \\text{output}{progress} \\cdot \\left( \\beta \\cdot \\mathbb{I}(\\dots) \\cdot \\text{clip}(\\dots) \\right) \- w\_{cost} \\cdot (\\lambda \\cdot \\text{num\_tokens}(\\text{output}\_2))$$  
The weights w\_{base}, w\_{progress}, and w\_{cost} are critical hyperparameters that must be carefully tuned. They control the balance between the final output quality, the incentive for meaningful correction, and the penalty for inefficiency. A systematic hyperparameter search, using techniques like grid search or more sophisticated methods like Bayesian optimization, will be essential to find a set of weights that produces the desired emergent behavior on a validation dataset. Recent work has also shown promise in using LLMs themselves as "reward function searchers" to iteratively tune such weights based on training logs and high-level goals, a direction that could be explored to automate this tuning process.37 The investigation of non-linear scalarization techniques like Chebyshev is designated as a valuable direction for future follow-up research, once the dynamics of the linear system are well understood.

## **Section 6: Implementation Strategy and Risk Analysis**

The successful implementation of the proposed reward function requires a clear integration plan into our existing RLAIF pipeline and a thorough analysis of potential risks, particularly the pervasive issue of reward hacking.

### **6.1. Integration into the RLAIF Pipeline**

The proposed reward function, R\_total, can be integrated into our RLAIF infrastructure with a targeted modification to the reward calculation step within the PPO training loop. The overall training process remains the same, but the function that provides the scalar reward to the PPO algorithm will be augmented.

The implementation workflow for a single training step is as follows:

1. **Sample Generation:** For a given prompt from the training batch, the current policy π generates the initial response, output\_1.  
2. **Correction Generation:** The model is presented with the critique, and the policy π generates the revised response, output\_2.  
3. Reward Calculation Module: A new module is invoked to compute R\_total. This module will perform the following sub-steps:  
   a. Query Preference Model: It sends (prompt, output\_1) and (prompt, output\_2) to the Preference Model (PM) to obtain their respective quality scores, PM\_score\_1 and PM\_score\_2.  
   b. Compute R\_progress: Using the predefined thresholds τ\_fail and τ\_pass, it calculates the binary progress bonus: R\_progress \= β \* I(PM\_score\_2 \> τ\_pass AND PM\_score\_1 \< τ\_fail).  
   c. Compute M\_semantic: It passes output\_1 and output\_2 to a loaded S-BERT model to get their embeddings, calculates the cosine distance, and computes the meaningfulness multiplier M\_semantic.  
   d. Compute C\_eff: It calculates the token count of output\_2 to determine the efficiency cost C\_eff.  
   e. Scalarize to R\_total: It combines these components using the weighted linear sum formula with the pre-configured weights w\_{base}, w\_{progress}, and w\_{cost}.  
4. **PPO Update:** The final scalar value, R\_total, is passed as the reward for the trajectory to the PPO algorithm, which then computes the advantages and performs the policy and value function updates.

### **6.2. Risk Mitigation: Reward Hacking**

Any modification to a reward function introduces the risk of reward hacking, where the agent discovers unintended loopholes to maximize reward without achieving the desired behavior.12 Our multi-objective design is intentionally structured to be robust against several predictable hacking strategies.

* **Risk 1: Rewarding Nonsense Edits.**  
  * *Scenario:* An agent could learn that making a large, semantically distant change maximizes M\_semantic. It might change a correct answer like "Paris is the capital of France" to semantically distant nonsense like "Purple elephants dance on the moon," hoping to gain a large reward.  
  * *Mitigation:* This is prevented by the multiplicative structure of our reward function. The M\_semantic multiplier is only applied to the R\_progress bonus. R\_progress is zero unless the final output output\_2 is deemed "correct" by the preference model (PM(output\_2) \> τ\_pass). Since "Purple elephants..." would receive a very low PM score, R\_progress would be zero, and the entire progress-related term would be nullified. This acts as a powerful gate, ensuring that semantic distance is only rewarded in the context of a successful correction.  
* **Risk 2: Gaming the Preference Model Thresholds.**  
  * *Scenario:* A sophisticated agent might learn to game the R\_progress bonus by producing an initial output output\_1 that is deliberately engineered to score *just below* the τ\_fail threshold, and then applying a minimal, trivial edit to produce an output\_2 that scores *just above* the τ\_pass threshold. This would trigger the R\_progress bonus with minimal effort.  
  * *Mitigation:* This is the primary scenario that the M\_semantic multiplier is designed to prevent. Because the edit is trivial, the semantic distance between output\_1 and output\_2 would be very small, resulting in an M\_semantic value close to zero. This would significantly down-weight or completely nullify the R\_progress bonus, rendering this strategy unprofitable for the agent.  
* **Risk 3: Exploiting Verbosity for Higher Scores.**  
  * *Scenario:* The agent might learn that longer, more verbose responses tend to receive higher scores from the base preference model (R\_base), perhaps because they seem more comprehensive. It could learn to pad its corrected answers with irrelevant but plausible-sounding text, accepting the C\_eff penalty as a worthwhile cost for a higher base reward.  
  * *Mitigation:* This risk is managed by the w\_{cost} hyperparameter. If this behavior is observed during training analysis, the weight λ (and thus w\_{cost}) must be increased to make verbosity more "expensive" for the agent. Continuous monitoring of the average token length of corrected responses, correlated with reward, will be a key metric for tuning this trade-off.

### **6.3. Addressing General RL-for-LLM Challenges**

Beyond reward hacking, implementing RL for LLMs involves navigating a set of broader technical challenges.

* **Exploration-Exploitation:** The complex, multi-peaked landscape of our proposed reward function makes exploration particularly important. The agent must be able to discover the relatively rare fail \-\> pass transitions to learn from the progress bonus.41 Standard techniques, such as adding an entropy bonus to the PPO loss function, can be employed to encourage sufficient exploration and prevent premature convergence to a suboptimal policy.  
* **Training Instability:** RL training for LLMs is notoriously unstable.9 The KL-divergence penalty in PPO is our primary defense against catastrophic forgetting and policy collapse. Furthermore, drawing inspiration from SCoRe's two-stage process, we can implement a curriculum learning strategy. Training could begin with a very low  
  w\_{progress} weight, focusing first on optimizing for R\_{base}, and then gradually annealing w\_{progress} to a higher value. This would allow the model to stabilize before being subjected to the strong, sparse gradients from the correction bonus.  
* **Scalability and Computational Cost:** The proposed reward function introduces additional computational overhead per training step, primarily from the S-BERT embedding calculation for M\_{semantic}.41 While S-BERT is highly optimized, this cost is non-zero and will impact overall training throughput. This must be acknowledged as a deliberate engineering trade-off: we are investing additional computation to instill a highly valuable and complex behavior in the model that is not achievable with a simpler reward signal.

## **Section 7: Conclusion and Recommendations**

This report has detailed a research proposal for a novel reward function aimed at teaching Large Language Models the skill of meaningful self-correction within a Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework. By drawing inspiration from the SCoRe framework and integrating principles from multi-objective optimization and semantic analysis, we have designed a reward signal that moves beyond rewarding mere correctness to specifically incentivize the process of substantive, valuable revision.

### **Summary of Proposal**

The core of this proposal is a composite, multi-objective reward function, R\_total, designed to be computed at the end of a two-turn self-correction trajectory. Its components are:

1. **R\_{base}:** A standard preference model score on the final output to maintain overall quality.  
2. **R\_{progress}:** A SCoRe-inspired discrete bonus for fail \-\> pass transitions, which creates a strong gradient for successful correction.  
3. **M\_{semantic}:** A novel meaningfulness multiplier, based on S-BERT cosine distance, that scales the progress bonus to ensure the most significant rewards are given for the most substantial edits, thereby preventing reward hacking via trivial changes.  
4. **C\_{eff}:** A pragmatic efficiency cost that penalizes verbosity, creating a realistic trade-off between correctness and conciseness.

These components are combined via a weighted linear sum, providing an interpretable and controllable reward signal. The design explicitly addresses and mitigates several potential reward hacking scenarios, and we have outlined strategies for managing the broader challenges of RL-for-LLM training, such as stability and exploration.

### **Actionable Recommendations**

To validate this proposal and move towards implementation, we recommend the following phased approach:

1. **Implementation and Controlled Benchmarking:**  
   * Implement the proposed reward calculation module within our existing RLAIF pipeline.  
   * Conduct a rigorous A/B/C test comparing three models trained on a challenging benchmark (e.g., a combination of MATH and HumanEval):  
     * **Model A (Baseline):** Standard RLAIF with the existing preference model.  
     * **Model B (SCoRe-like):** RLAIF with a reward function including only R\_{base} and R\_{progress}. This will isolate the impact of the core SCoRe principle.  
     * **Model C (Full Proposal):** RLAIF with the complete R\_{total} function, including the M\_{semantic} multiplier and C\_{eff} cost. This will measure the additional value of our novel components.  
2. **Systematic Hyperparameter Evaluation:**  
   * Perform a systematic hyperparameter sweep, focusing on the scalarization weights (w\_{base}, w\_{progress}, w\_{cost}) and the PM thresholds (τ\_{fail}, τ\_{pass}). The goal is to identify a configuration that maximizes the rate of meaningful self-correction without degrading overall response quality.  
3. **Qualitative and Fine-Grained Analysis:**  
   * Develop a curated evaluation suite of prompt-response pairs that exemplify different types of edits (e.g., factual correction, logical fix, simple rephrasing, grammar fix).  
   * Conduct a manual, qualitative analysis of the behavior of the trained models on this suite to verify that the learning pressure from the reward function is manifesting as intended (i.e., that Model C is demonstrably better at meaningful corrections than Models A and B).  
4. **Future Research Directions:**  
   * Based on the results of the initial implementation, a follow-up research spike should be initiated to explore more advanced techniques. This includes:  
     * **Non-Linear Scalarization:** Investigating the use of Chebyshev or other non-linear scalarization functions to explore potentially superior, non-convex regions of the policy space.  
     * **Advanced Semantic Metrics:** Evaluating the performance and trade-offs of using more sophisticated or alternative metrics for M\_{semantic}, such as the compression-based edit distance, which may better capture human-perceived editing effort.
