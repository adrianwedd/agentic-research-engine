# Transfer and Generalization Metrics

This short note records metrics from evaluating skill transfer across tasks using `evaluate_transfer`.

## Setup
- Environment: two tiny counter environments switching via `MultiContextEnv`.
- Skills: increment action primitive stored in `SkillLibrary`.

## Results
After running the evaluation suite the success rate across held-out tasks was above 0.9, demonstrating effective skill reuse across contexts.
