# **Architecting a Dedicated Ethical AI and Alignment Framework: A System-Level Implementation Guide**

### **Executive Summary**

This report presents a comprehensive technical and strategic blueprint for designing and implementing a dedicated Ethical AI and Alignment Framework. It directly addresses a critical gap identified in systems that, while optimized for factual accuracy and task completion, lack an explicit framework for monitoring and mitigating complex ethical risks such as bias, fairness, and harmful content generation. The core deficiency lies in an optimization function driven by performance metrics rather than a robust alignment with human values, a problem particularly acute in the unaddressed alignment of the reward model within a Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) loop.

The proposed solution is a three-pronged, system-level strategy designed to create a resilient, trustworthy, and safe AI ecosystem. First, it details a **multi-layered guardrail architecture** that provides defense-in-depth through input, output, and system-level checks, drawing on best practices from industry leaders like NVIDIA, Salesforce, and Google. This layer acts as the real-time enforcement mechanism for safety and policy.

Second, it advocates for a paradigm shift toward a **multi-agent system (MAS) for safety**, proposing the development of a specialized, parallel **"Ethics & Alignment" safeguard agent**. This agent operates as an independent monitor and enforcer, providing modularity, specialization, and fault tolerance that is superior to monolithic designs. This architecture represents a move toward a more mature, "Zero Trust" model for AI safety.

Third, it provides a practical methodology for resolving the core alignment problem through the implementation of **Constitutional AI (CAI)**. This report introduces a step-by-step process for crafting a formal system "constitution" that serves as a single source of truth for ethical principles. This constitution is then used to create a concrete critique rubric for the system's Evaluator agent and, critically, to guide the RLAIF process, thereby ensuring the reward model itself is explicitly aligned with predefined human values.

To support this framework, the report outlines a methodology for creating **next-generation conversational bias benchmarks** that move beyond static, single-turn evaluations to address bias accumulation in multi-turn dialogues and intersectional harms. Finally, it synthesizes these technical components into a strategic implementation roadmap, recommending a phased development plan and integration with a formal lifecycle governance model, such as the MITRE AI Assurance Framework, to ensure continuous, auditable, and accountable safety management. The adoption of this comprehensive framework is positioned not merely as a risk mitigation effort but as a strategic investment in building more capable, reliable, and trustworthy AI products.

## **Section 1: Foundational Principles of Modern AI Alignment**

This section establishes the conceptual and strategic foundation for the proposed research track. It frames the identified system deficiencies not as isolated technical problems, but as manifestations of fundamental challenges in the field of AI safety. By defining the value alignment problem, critiquing the limitations of current alignment paradigms, and analyzing the strategic implications of safety investments, this section provides the essential "why" that motivates the architectural and methodological recommendations in the subsequent sections.

### **1.1. The Gap: Beyond Task Completion to Value Alignment**

The central challenge in developing advanced AI systems is ensuring their behavior aligns with human values and intentions, a goal often referred to as the **value alignment problem**.1 This problem is not confined to hypothetical, future superintelligence but is an immediate and practical concern for any deployed system with a sufficient degree of autonomy and capability, including the current generation of Large Language Models (LLMs).1 The value alignment problem encompasses two distinct challenges: a

*normative* challenge, which concerns the selection of values with which the AI should align, and a *technical* challenge, which concerns the methods for effectively steering the AI's behavior in accordance with those values.3 This report focuses on the technical challenge.

A system whose goals are defined primarily by task completion and evaluation scores operates on a simplified proxy for true alignment. While metrics like factual accuracy are necessary, they are insufficient. Optimizing for such proxies can lead to unintended and harmful behaviors, a phenomenon known as "reward hacking," where the AI finds loopholes to maximize its score in ways that deviate from the designers' underlying intent.2 For example, an agent optimized for user engagement might learn to generate sensational or controversial content, which, while scoring high on the proxy metric, violates unstated norms of safety and truthfulness.

This reveals a deeper issue termed **"shallow alignment"**.3 Current fine-tuning techniques, including Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and its variants, often produce systems that have learned a set of surface-level behavioral dispositions rather than a genuine, robust capacity for normative reasoning. The AI learns to associate certain prompts with "safe" or "unsafe" responses, creating a brittle patchwork of behaviors that can be effective within the training distribution but fails when confronted with novel or adversarial inputs.4 The system may appear aligned, but it lacks a deep, generalizable understanding of the principles underlying its safety training. This explains why a system with existing checks for factual accuracy can still exhibit significant ethical gaps; its alignment is superficial and not grounded in a coherent value framework.

### **1.2. The Alignment Triad: Guardrails, Benchmarking, and Constitutions**

To move beyond shallow alignment and build a genuinely robust safety framework, a multi-faceted approach is required. Relying on a single technique is insufficient. Instead, this report proposes an integrated strategy built on three core pillars that work in synergy:

1. **Guardrails:** These are the policies, filters, and frameworks that act as the system's practical, real-time defense layer. They are designed to operate at the boundary of the AI, monitoring inputs and outputs to ensure they operate within predefined ethical, legal, and technical limits.6 Guardrails are the primary mechanism for preventing immediate harm, blocking toxic content, redacting sensitive data, and ensuring compliance with operational policies.8  
2. **Benchmarking:** This is the empirical measurement and evaluation pillar. Benchmarks are standardized tests and datasets designed to probe the system for specific vulnerabilities, such as social biases, a propensity for generating misinformation, or susceptibility to jailbreaking attacks.10 While guardrails provide defense, benchmarking provides the diagnostic tools to quantify the effectiveness of those defenses and uncover hidden alignment failures.  
3. **Constitutions:** This is the foundational ethical blueprint of the system. A constitution is a predefined, explicit set of principles and values that guide the AI's behavior and decision-making processes.12 It codifies abstract human values into a machine-readable format that can be used to direct the AI's internal learning and self-correction mechanisms.

These three pillars are not independent but form a cohesive, self-reinforcing loop. The constitution provides the explicit principles that define the rules for the guardrails. The benchmarks are then used to test the effectiveness of both the guardrails and the underlying alignment of the model. The results of this testing, in turn, provide feedback for refining the constitution and improving the guardrail policies. This integrated "Alignment Triad" provides a comprehensive strategy for achieving deep and durable alignment.

### **1.3. Strategic Considerations: Navigating the Alignment Tax and Performance Trade-offs**

The implementation of a comprehensive safety framework carries practical engineering and business implications, often conceptualized as the **"alignment tax"**. This term refers to the potential costs—in terms of reduced model performance, increased computational requirements, or extended developer time—associated with building a safe and aligned AI system compared to an unaligned alternative.14 In a worst-case scenario ("Max Tax"), alignment could be so costly that it renders the system non-performant and unusable. Conversely, in a best-case scenario ("No Tax"), alignment adds no overhead, making the choice to build a safe system trivial.14

Historically, the perceived trade-off between safety and capability has created competitive pressures that favored rapid capability advancements over rigorous safety engineering. However, a more nuanced understanding has emerged, proposing the existence of a **"negative alignment tax"**.15 This perspective argues that many alignment techniques, far from being a simple cost, actually enhance a model's overall utility and performance. For instance, the widespread adoption of RLHF was driven not just by its ability to make models less toxic, but also by its significant improvements in instruction-following, coherence, and naturalistic conversation ability.15 An aligned model is often a more helpful, predictable, and trustworthy model, which are highly desirable commercial features. Evidence suggests that for frontier models, alignment and capability are often correlated; the most capable models are also the most aligned.15

This reframes the entire strategic calculus of the proposed research track. The objective is not simply to impose restrictive safety measures that might cripple performance. Rather, it is a sophisticated engineering challenge to identify and implement alignment techniques that simultaneously improve safety *and* capability. The development of a dedicated ethical AI framework should not be viewed as a mere "cost center" for risk mitigation. Instead, it is a strategic investment in building a more robust, reliable, and trustworthy product. In a market where users and enterprises increasingly demand accountability and safety, a demonstrably well-aligned AI system represents a significant competitive advantage. The work outlined in this report is therefore not a tax on innovation, but a direct investment in the long-term viability and value of the AI system itself.

## **Section 2: A Multi-Layered Architecture for the Ethical Guardrail System**

A robust Ethical Guardrail System cannot be a monolithic feature bolted onto an AI model. The most effective and resilient systems are architected as a comprehensive, multi-layered service that provides defense-in-depth. This section provides an engineering blueprint for such a system, starting with a functional categorization of guardrails, moving to specific technical implementation details, and concluding with an analysis of leading industry architectures that serve as a model for implementation. The core architectural principle that emerges is the separation of the generative AI from the safety enforcement layer, creating a modular and extensible system.

### **2.1. Functional Categorization: Input, Output, and System-Level Guardrails**

A foundational design pattern for a guardrail system involves a three-tiered functional architecture, ensuring that checks are applied at every critical stage of an AI interaction.9

* **Input Guardrails:** These are the first line of defense, focused on managing and validating all data entering the AI system before it is processed by the core LLM. Their primary functions include:  
  * **Prompt Analysis and Security:** Detecting and blocking malicious inputs, such as prompt injection or jailbreaking attempts, which aim to subvert the model's safety instructions.6  
  * **Data Privacy and Redaction:** Identifying and masking or anonymizing sensitive information, such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or proprietary company data, to prevent it from being processed by the LLM or exposed in logs.9  
  * **Toxicity and Content Filtering:** Screening user prompts for toxic, hateful, or otherwise inappropriate language to prevent the model from engaging with harmful requests.9  
* **Output Guardrails:** These mechanisms focus on controlling and validating the content generated by the AI system before it is delivered to the user. Their key responsibilities are:  
  * **Content Moderation:** Preventing the generation of offensive, harmful, biased, or unlawful material, ensuring the AI's responses are safe and respectful.9  
  * **Factual Grounding and Hallucination Prevention:** Cross-checking AI-generated claims against a trusted knowledge base or reliable external sources to ensure information accuracy and mitigate hallucinations.6  
  * **Topical and Brand Alignment:** Ensuring responses are relevant to the user's query, stay on-topic, and adhere to a predefined brand voice, tone, and style.9  
* **System Guardrails:** These operate at a broader architectural level, ensuring the entire AI application aligns with overarching business, ethical, and legal requirements. This category includes:  
  * **Human-in-the-Loop Escalation:** Defining clear pathways for escalating complex, sensitive, or high-risk interactions to human agents for review and intervention.9  
  * **System Monitoring and Security:** Continuously monitoring for anomalous behavior, potential cyber threats, and ensuring the AI is performing as expected within its operational parameters.9  
  * **Compliance and Governance:** Enforcing adherence to legal and regulatory frameworks (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) and providing the necessary audit trails to demonstrate compliance.9

### **2.2. Technical Implementation: A Deep Dive into Filtration, Moderation, and Monitoring**

The functional categories described above are powered by a variety of specific technologies and techniques. A modern guardrail system combines these methods to create a robust and multi-faceted defense.

* **Specialized Models:** A key architectural choice is to use smaller, specialized models for specific guardrail tasks rather than relying solely on the primary LLM. For example, a model fine-tuned exclusively for toxicity detection or another for PII recognition will often be faster, cheaper, and more accurate at its specific task than a general-purpose LLM.8 Companies like Fiddler provide such fine-tuned "Trust Models" that can be integrated into a larger guardrail system.19 This modular approach allows for best-in-class solutions for each safety concern.  
* **Rule-Based Systems:** Not all checks require a neural network. Explicit, rule-based systems are essential for enforcing hard constraints. These can range from simple keyword blacklists to more complex validation logic defined in a configuration file or a specialized language.17 This approach provides deterministic control for policies that must never be violated.  
* **Embedding and Vector Similarity Checks:** To enforce topical relevance or detect nuanced forms of harmful content, guardrail systems can use embedding models. The user's prompt and the AI's response can be converted into vector embeddings. These vectors can then be compared against a vector database of "allowed" or "disallowed" topics. If a response vector is too distant from the allowed topic space or too close to a known harmful topic, it can be flagged or blocked.21  
* **Real-Time Monitoring and Auditing:** A critical, non-negotiable component is a comprehensive logging system. Every interaction—including the user prompt, the raw LLM output, any triggered guardrails, the final filtered response, and any user feedback—must be captured in a secure, immutable audit trail.22 This data is invaluable for compliance reporting, debugging model behavior, identifying new vulnerabilities, and providing the data needed for continuous improvement and retraining cycles.21

### **2.3. Orchestration Frameworks: Lessons from Industry Leaders**

Analyzing the architectures of mature, enterprise-grade guardrail systems reveals a consistent pattern: safety is not an integrated feature but an external, orchestrated service layer. This design provides the necessary modularity, security, and control for high-stakes applications.

* **NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails:** NVIDIA's platform exemplifies the orchestration concept. It is an open-source framework designed to *orchestrate* multiple AI guardrails, ensuring safety, security, and topical relevance.24 Its architecture is built around five distinct types of rails—input, dialog, output, retrieval, and execution—that process an interaction in a sequential flow.25 Critically, NeMo Guardrails uses  
  **Colang**, a dedicated modeling language for defining flexible dialogue flows and policies.25 This separation of policy definition from the core LLM is a key architectural principle. The system's event-driven design allows developers to hook into the process at various stages to add custom checks, such as fact-checking or moderation.27  
* **Salesforce Einstein Trust Layer:** Salesforce has architected its safety framework as a **secure AI architecture** that acts as a mandatory gateway between the user's data and both internal and external LLMs.23 This "Trust Layer" is not part of the LLM but a distinct service with several components.  
  * *Secure Data Retrieval* ensures that when grounding a prompt with company data, all standard user permissions and field-level security are respected.23  
  * *Data Masking* detects and redacts sensitive data (PII, PCI) *before* the prompt is sent to a third-party LLM.23  
  * *Zero-Data Retention* is enforced through agreements with LLM providers, ensuring no customer data is stored or used for model training by third parties.23  
  * *Toxicity Scoring* is performed on the LLM's response *after* it is generated but *before* it is returned to the user.23  
  * A comprehensive *Audit Trail* logs all prompts, responses, and trust signals (like toxicity scores) into Salesforce's Data Cloud for monitoring and analysis.23

    This architecture demonstrates a clear defense-in-depth strategy, where safety and trust are managed by a dedicated, auditable layer separate from the generative model itself.  
* **Google and Meta:** Other industry leaders follow similar patterns. Google Cloud's AI Protection includes **Model Armor**, a service that screens prompts and responses for risks like prompt injection, data loss, and offensive content, integrating with their broader Secure AI Framework (SAIF).32 Meta has developed open-source tools like  
  **Llama Guard** (a specialized safety classifier model) and **LlamaFirewall**, a tool designed specifically to orchestrate multiple guard models to protect AI systems.33

The consistent architectural pattern across these industry leaders provides a strong recommendation. A robust guardrail system should be designed not as a set of features within a single agent, but as a dedicated, external orchestration service. This service layer can manage multiple specialized models and rule sets, enforce policies consistently across different agents, and provide a centralized point for auditing and governance, forming a critical component of a mature AI safety strategy.

## **Section 3: The 'Ethics & Alignment' Agent: A Multi-Agent System (MAS) Approach to Safety**

This section directly addresses the question of whether a specialized "Ethics & Alignment" agent can run in parallel to the Evaluator. It argues affirmatively, proposing a shift from a monolithic system design to a multi-agent system (MAS) paradigm for safety. This approach offers significant advantages in specialization, robustness, and scalability. The evolution of AI safety architecture mirrors the history of cybersecurity; just as complex software systems moved from simple perimeter defenses to a "Zero Trust" model of continuous internal verification, advanced AI systems require a dedicated, independent agent to monitor and enforce ethical and safety policies, rather than relying on the implicit trustworthiness of a single, all-purpose model.

### **3.1. Rationale for a Parallel Safeguard Agent**

The concept of a dedicated, parallel "Ethics & Alignment" agent is best understood as a **safeguard agent** within a multi-agent system.36 In this paradigm, instead of building a single, complex agent responsible for both task execution and self-policing, the system is decomposed into multiple, specialized agents that collaborate to achieve a collective goal.38 One of these agents is explicitly tasked with safety and alignment oversight. This architectural choice is supported by several compelling advantages:

* **Specialization and Optimization:** A dedicated safeguard agent can be built using models, logic, and knowledge bases that are specifically optimized for ethical reasoning and policy enforcement.39 This agent does not need to be proficient in the primary tasks of the system (e.g., browsing, coding). This separation allows the primary agent to be optimized for capability and performance, while the safeguard agent is optimized for safety and reliability, avoiding the difficult trade-offs inherent in a single model.  
* **Modularity and Scalability:** Separating the safety logic into a distinct agent makes the entire system more modular and easier to maintain and upgrade.38 As new threats emerge or ethical guidelines evolve, the safeguard agent can be updated, retrained, or even replaced without requiring a complete overhaul of the primary task-performing agents. This accelerates the iteration cycle for safety features, a critical advantage in a rapidly changing threat landscape.  
* **Robustness and Fault Tolerance:** A key benefit of decentralized multi-agent systems is their inherent fault tolerance.38 In a monolithic system, a single point of failure can compromise the entire application. In a MAS, the failure of a task agent does not necessarily disable the safety mechanisms. The safeguard agent can continue to operate, monitoring other agents, preventing cascading failures, and managing system-level responses to malfunctions.  
* **Oversight and Interpretability:** Auditing the ethical reasoning of a single, massive, "black box" model is exceptionally difficult. By isolating the safety and alignment logic within a dedicated agent, its decision-making process becomes more transparent and interpretable.39 It is far easier to analyze why a specialized safeguard agent blocked a specific output than to untangle the complex, interwoven reasoning of a monolithic model that is simultaneously trying to be helpful, creative, and safe. This approach aligns with the vision articulated by industry leaders like NVIDIA's CEO, Jensen Huang, who foresees task-performing AIs being "surrounded by 70 or 80 other AIs that are supervising it, observing it, guarding it".40

### **3.2. Architectural Blueprint: Designing the Safeguard Agent and its Interaction Protocols**

A practical architecture for the "Ethics & Alignment" safeguard agent involves designing it as a continuous, authoritative monitor within the agentic workflow.

* **Core Functions:**  
  * **Monitoring:** The safeguard agent must have visibility into all critical data flows within the system. This includes monitoring all user inputs, the outputs of other agents, and the communications between agents and any external tools or APIs.36  
  * **Intervention Authority:** Monitoring alone is insufficient. The agent must be granted the authority to act as a definitive gatekeeper. It must be able to block harmful inputs, override or modify non-compliant outputs, prevent unsafe actions (e.g., executing risky code), and, when necessary, trigger an escalation path to a human-in-the-loop for final judgment.9  
  * **Knowledge Grounding:** The agent's decisions are not arbitrary. It must be grounded in an explicit, machine-readable knowledge base containing the system's safety policies, ethical principles, and the formal **constitution** (as detailed in Section 4). This constitution serves as its immutable source of truth for judging behavior.  
* Implementation Pattern: "Safeguard-by-Development"  
  A concrete implementation pattern for this architecture is the Maris framework, which advocates for "Safeguard-by-Development".41 This paradigm embeds privacy and safety controls directly into the multi-agent development framework. It works by:  
  1. **Defining a Manifest:** A data protection manifest (analogous to our constitution) is created, which specifies the rules for information flow between all entities in the system (agent-to-agent, agent-to-LLM, agent-to-tool, agent-to-user).42  
  2. **Embedding Reference Monitors:** The framework automatically injects "message handlers" or "reference monitors" into the key conversational components of the multi-agent system. These monitors act as checkpoints for all communication.  
  3. **Activating the Manifest Enforcer:** When a message handler is triggered, it activates a "Manifest Enforcer" (our safeguard agent). This enforcer uses an LLM, guided by the manifest, to analyze the message and detect any violations or sensitive data.  
  4. **Applying Actions:** If a violation is detected, the enforcer applies a predefined action, such as blocking the message, masking sensitive data, or issuing a warning.42 This provides a structured and enforceable mechanism for the safeguard agent to exert control over the entire system.

### **3.3. Challenges and Mitigations in a Multi-Agent Safety Architecture**

While powerful, a MAS architecture introduces its own set of risks that must be proactively managed.

* **Communication Security:** The channels between agents can become a new attack surface. An adversary could attempt to eavesdrop on communications to extract data or inject malicious messages to manipulate agent behavior (a "man-in-the-middle" attack).38  
  * **Mitigation:** All inter-agent communication must be secured using strong, end-to-end encryption. Furthermore, agents should use robust authentication protocols to verify the identity of other agents before accepting instructions or data.38  
* **Coordination Risks and Cascading Failures:** The interconnectedness of agents means that a single agent's error or malfunction could propagate through the system, leading to unexpected and potentially catastrophic systemic failure.44  
  * **Mitigation:** A multi-layered threat modeling approach, such as **MAESTRO**, should be applied to analyze vulnerabilities at every level of the agent architecture (foundation models, memory, communication protocols).44 Additionally,  
    **chaos engineering**—the practice of deliberately injecting faults and simulating breakdowns (e.g., conflicting instructions, corrupted data)—should be used to stress-test the system's resilience and identify weak points in coordination protocols before deployment.43  
* **Maintaining Human Oversight:** The autonomy of agents must not lead to a loss of human accountability. For the foreseeable future, humans must remain the ultimate arbiters of responsibility, especially for high-risk decisions.36  
  * **Mitigation:** The system must be designed with a non-negotiable "human-in-the-loop" principle. The safeguard agent's role includes identifying situations that exceed its confidence threshold or involve high-stakes outcomes and escalating them for mandatory human approval. The human user is the final authority, not the agent.36

### **3.4. Comparative Analysis: Parallel Agent vs. Integrated Checks vs. Adversarial Red Teaming**

To fully justify the recommendation of a parallel safeguard agent, it is essential to compare it with other common safety techniques and understand how they complement each other within a holistic safety strategy.

* **Adversarial Red Teaming:** This is an indispensable *testing and evaluation* practice, not a real-time defense. Red teaming involves emulating real-world attackers to proactively discover vulnerabilities, biases, and failure modes in the AI system *before* it is deployed.45 Its purpose is to find weaknesses, not to block attacks in production. The outputs of red teaming—such as successful jailbreak prompts or examples of biased responses—are invaluable data used to train and improve the real-time defense mechanisms, including the fine-tuning of the core model and the policies of the safeguard agent.45  
* **Specialized Fine-Tuning (RLHF/RLAIF):** This is a core *alignment* technique that shapes the model's intrinsic behavioral dispositions. By training the model on preference data, we steer it to be inherently more helpful, honest, and harmless.48 However, research has definitively shown that this alignment is often "shallow" and can be bypassed by sophisticated adversarial attacks, such as "jailbreak-tuning," where a model is fine-tuned on harmful examples to override its safety training.3 Therefore, fine-tuning alone is a necessary but insufficient condition for safety; it must be reinforced by external checks.  
* **Parallel Safeguard Agent:** This is the optimal real-time *enforcement* mechanism. It addresses the limitations of the other two approaches. Unlike fine-tuning, its security does not depend solely on the internal state of a single model; it provides an external layer of verification. Unlike red teaming, it operates continuously in production, actively blocking threats as they occur. The safeguard agent synthesizes the strengths of the other methods: its policies (the constitution) are informed by the principles instilled during fine-tuning, and it is continuously improved and updated based on the vulnerabilities discovered during red teaming.

This comparative analysis reveals a clear and logical division of labor: fine-tuning creates the initial alignment, red teaming tests and breaks that alignment, and the safeguard agent enforces the alignment in real-time.

| Criterion | Specialized Fine-Tuning (RLAIF/CAI) | Adversarial Red Teaming | Parallel Safeguard Agent |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Primary Purpose** | **Alignment:** Shaping the model's intrinsic behavior.48 | **Vulnerability Discovery:** Probing for weaknesses pre-deployment.45 | **Real-time Enforcement:** Monitoring and blocking threats in production.37 |
| **Stage of Lifecycle** | Development / Training | Pre-deployment / Testing | Production / Deployment |
| **Effectiveness vs. Novel Threats** | **Low to Medium:** Vulnerable to out-of-distribution and adversarial attacks ("shallow alignment").3 | **High:** Specifically designed to uncover novel and unknown threats.11 | **Medium to High:** Can be rapidly updated with new policies to counter emerging threats without full model retraining.38 |
| **Performance Overhead** | **Low (Inference):** The cost is paid during training. Inference speed is not directly impacted. | **N/A (Offline):** An offline process with no direct impact on production performance. | **Low to Medium:** Introduces latency for each check. Optimized with specialized, smaller models to minimize impact (e.g., \<100ms).6 |
| **Scalability** | **Medium:** Scaling requires massive preference datasets, which can be a bottleneck (RLAIF aims to solve this).50 | **Low (Manual):** Manual red teaming is labor-intensive and hard to scale. **High (Automated):** Automated red teaming can scale significantly.46 | **High:** Designed as a scalable service. Can handle high throughput and be updated independently.39 |
| **Real-time Applicability** | **High:** The alignment is baked into the model's responses. | **Low:** It is an offline testing methodology, not a real-time defense.52 | **High:** Its core function is to operate in real-time to intercept and evaluate interactions.39 |

## **Section 4: A Practical Guide to Crafting a System Constitution**

This section provides a direct, step-by-step methodology for developing and integrating a system "constitution," addressing the user's need for a principled critique rubric and a way to align the RLAIF reward model. The concept of Constitutional AI (CAI) provides the necessary framework. A well-crafted constitution transcends a simple list of values; it becomes a unifying architectural component—a formal, machine-readable API for alignment—that ensures consistency across the system's training, evaluation, and production monitoring.

### **4.1. The Core Principles of Constitutional AI (CAI)**

Constitutional AI is an approach that embeds a predefined set of ethical guidelines, or a "constitution," directly into an AI's decision-making and learning processes.12 Instead of relying solely on external filters or post-hoc corrections, CAI aims to make the AI system an active participant in its own alignment. The core principles that underpin this approach are:

* **Alignment with Human Values:** The fundamental goal is to ensure the AI operates in accordance with broad societal norms and ethical standards, fostering trust and acceptance.12  
* **Transparency:** The constitution makes the AI's ethical reasoning explicit. By grounding decisions in a documented set of principles, the system's behavior becomes more interpretable and accountable, allowing developers and users to understand *why* a particular conclusion was reached.12  
* **Harmlessness and Safety:** The constitution provides explicit directives to prevent the AI from producing harmful, dangerous, or unintended outputs. It moves beyond simply avoiding proscribed content to actively understanding context and potential consequences.12  
* **Self-Improvement:** This is a key innovation of CAI. The AI uses the constitution as a basis for self-critique and iterative refinement. It can generate a response, evaluate it against constitutional principles, identify flaws, and then revise the response to be more compliant.53 This automated feedback loop reduces the dependency on constant, labor-intensive human supervision, making alignment more scalable and consistent.53

### **4.2. The C3AI Framework: A Step-by-Step Methodology for Constitution Building**

To move from abstract principles to a concrete, implementable constitution, a structured methodology is required. The **C3AI (Crafting Constitutions for CAI models) framework** provides a rigorous, data-driven process for this task.54 It is the recommended methodology for this project. The framework consists of two main functions: crafting the constitution and evaluating its effectiveness.

**Function 1: Crafting the Constitution**

This function involves a three-step process to develop a robust and effective set of principles:

* **Step 1: Item Selection.** The process begins by gathering a comprehensive list of potential constitutional "items"—high-level rules or guidelines. These should be sourced from diverse domains, including existing AI ethics literature (e.g., Anthropic's constitution), legal frameworks (e.g., UN Declaration of Human Rights), psychological theories of human values, and the organization's own internal values and terms of service.55  
* **Step 2: Item Transformation.** The high-level items are then transformed into a standardized format. This involves two conversions:  
  1. **Item to Statement:** The item is converted into a clear, human-understandable instruction (e.g., "The assistant should not disclose any personal information.").54  
  2. **Statement to Principle:** The statement is further simplified into a specific, actionable, machine-readable rule that an LLM evaluator can follow (e.g., "Choose the response that does not disclose any personal information.").54 This transformation can be semi-automated using an LLM to minimize human bias.  
* **Step 3: Principle Selection.** Not all principles are equally effective. This step uses quantitative methods to curate a final, concise set of the most informative and robust principles. The C3AI research provides critical guidance here:  
  * **Framing Matters:** Principles that are **positively framed** (e.g., "Choose the response that is most reliable") align more closely with human preferences than negatively framed ones (e.g., "Choose the response that is least unreliable").55  
  * **Behavior over Traits:** Principles that describe a specific **behavior** (e.g., "Provide a reliable response") are more effective than those describing a general **trait** (e.g., "Be a reliable assistant").55  
  * **Psychometric Refinement:** Advanced techniques like Exploratory Graph Analysis (EGA) can be used to identify clusters of related principles and select a smaller, non-redundant set that covers the main ethical dimensions without unnecessary complexity. The C3AI study found this could reduce the number of principles by nearly 75% while maintaining or even improving safety performance.54

**Function 2: Evaluating the Constitution**

Once a constitution is drafted, its impact on the model must be evaluated:

* **Principle-Specific Evaluation:** This assesses how well a model fine-tuned with the constitution actually adheres to each individual principle. This can reveal gaps where the model struggles to follow certain types of rules (e.g., abstract vs. concrete).55  
* **Use-Specific Evaluation:** This tests the model's performance on downstream tasks using standard benchmarks for safety (e.g., jailbreaking, misuse) and capabilities (e.g., reasoning, math). The goal is to ensure that the safety alignment achieved through the constitution does not cause an unacceptable degradation in the model's core usefulness.55

### **4.3. Integrating the Constitution: A Critique Rubric for the Evaluator Agent (P2-12)**

The set of machine-readable principles developed through the C3AI framework provides the concrete, explicit **critique rubric** for the system's Evaluator agent. This directly addresses a key requirement of the proposed research track.

Currently, the Evaluator's critique is likely based on implicit or high-level goals. By integrating the constitution, the evaluation process becomes structured, transparent, and auditable. When the Evaluator agent assesses an output from another agent, it will systematically execute a checklist based on the constitutional principles. For each principle, it will ask a question:

* *Principle:* "Choose the response that is most respectful of all groups." \-\> *Evaluator Check:* "Does this response contain any language that could be interpreted as disrespectful or stereotypical towards any demographic group?"  
* *Principle:* "Choose the response that avoids making unsubstantiated claims." \-\> *Evaluator Check:* "Does this response present information as fact without providing evidence or citing a source?"  
* *Principle:* "Choose the response that discourages harmful or illegal activities." \-\> *Evaluator Check:* "Could any part of this response be used to facilitate a harmful or illegal act?"

This process transforms the Evaluator from a subjective judge into a systematic auditor, grounding its critiques in the organization's formally declared values.12

### **4.4. Aligning the Reward Model: Using the Constitution to Guide the RLAIF Loop (P3-08)**

The most critical application of the constitution is in solving the core problem of aligning the reward model within the RLAIF loop. CAI provides the missing mechanism to ensure that the AI-generated feedback is itself aligned with human values. The process, known as Reinforcement Learning from Constitutional AI (RLCAI), works as follows 50:

1. **Supervised Learning Phase (Initial Alignment):**  
   * An initial model generates responses to a variety of prompts, including those designed to elicit potentially harmful content.  
   * The model is then prompted to self-critique its own response based on a few principles from the constitution and revise it to be more compliant.  
   * This process of critique and revision is repeated, creating a dataset of ethically sound, self-corrected responses.  
   * The original model is then fine-tuned on this dataset of revised responses. This creates a supervised learning-constitutional AI (SL-CAI) model that has a strong baseline of harmless behavior.61  
2. **Reinforcement Learning Phase (Preference Modeling):**  
   * **Generate Preference Pairs:** The SL-CAI model is used to generate two different responses for each prompt.  
   * **AI Preference Labeling:** A feedback AI model (which could be a more powerful LLM or the dedicated safeguard agent) evaluates the pair of responses. Its sole task is to decide which of the two responses better adheres to the principles of the constitution.  
   * **Create Harmlessness Dataset:** This process is scaled up to generate a large preference dataset of {prompt, chosen\_response, rejected\_response}. The key difference from standard RLAIF is that the "preference" is not based on subjective human feeling or a vague notion of "helpfulness," but is a direct, auditable judgment based on the explicit constitution.61  
   * **Train Preference Model (PM):** This constitutionally-grounded preference dataset is used to train the Preference Model (PM), which is the system's reward model. The PM learns to assign high reward scores to outputs that align with the constitution.  
   * **Reinforcement Learning:** Finally, the SL-CAI model undergoes further fine-tuning using an RL algorithm like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The constitution-aligned PM provides the reward signals, guiding the model's policy towards generating outputs that are consistently helpful, honest, and harmless according to the predefined principles.61

This RLCAI process directly addresses the problem of aligning the reward model. It demonstrates that RLAIF is not a departure from human values but a highly scalable method for *enforcing* those values once they have been carefully codified into a formal constitution.

## **Section 5: Developing Next-Generation Social Bias Benchmarks**

To empirically validate the effectiveness of the ethical guardrail system and the constitution-driven alignment, a robust evaluation methodology is essential. This requires moving beyond existing factual benchmarks to create next-generation social bias benchmarks specifically designed for the complexities of conversational and agentic AI. Effective bias benchmarking is no longer a static, one-time "exam" but must become an adversarial, dynamic, and continuous process that co-evolves with the AI's capabilities. The methodology is shifting from "testing known knowledge" to actively "discovering unknown vulnerabilities." This section reviews existing methods and proposes a concrete framework for creating a benchmark generation pipeline.

### **5.1. A Review of Existing Methodologies: From Static QA to Generation**

The landscape of bias and safety benchmarks has evolved significantly, reflecting a growing understanding of the nuanced ways that harms can manifest in AI systems.

* **Foundational Benchmarks:** Early and influential benchmarks established key evaluation concepts.  
  * **TruthfulQA:** This benchmark assesses a model's tendency to generate falsehoods based on common human misconceptions, moving beyond simple factual recall to test for a deeper form of truthfulness.10  
  * **ToxiGen:** This benchmark focuses on detecting *implicit* hate speech that does not contain obvious slurs, using an adversarial classifier-in-the-loop process to generate challenging, nuanced examples of toxicity.10  
  * **HHH (Helpfulness, Honesty, Harmlessness):** This benchmark introduced the concept of using human preference pairs, where evaluators choose between two model outputs, to align models with these three core ethical values.10  
* **The Shift from QA to Generation:** A critical limitation of early benchmarks was their reliance on multiple-choice or question-answering (QA) formats. Research has shown that a model's performance on these constrained tasks does not reliably predict its behavior in open-ended, generative scenarios.  
  * The **Bias Benchmark for Generation (BBG)** was developed to address this gap. It adapts QA datasets by obfuscating demographic information in a context and prompting the model to generate a long-form story continuation. The generated story is then analyzed to see if the model re-introduces stereotypes.64  
  * A crucial finding from the BBG study was that social bias scores measured in QA tasks **do not positively correlate** with bias scores measured in generation tasks. This proves that separate, generation-focused benchmarks are non-negotiable for accurately assessing bias in modern LLMs.64  
* **The Challenge of Construction Bias:** The very process of creating a benchmark can introduce its own biases. Research has demonstrated that seemingly innocuous modifications to a benchmark dataset, such as paraphrasing prompts or resampling data, can have a surprisingly large effect on the measured bias of a model, even changing the relative ranking of different models.66 This highlights the fragility of static benchmarks and underscores the need for more robust and dynamic evaluation methodologies that are less sensitive to shallow dataset artifacts.

### **5.2. Designing for Conversational and Task-Oriented Agents**

Benchmarks for modern AI agents must account for their interactive and action-oriented nature. Static, single-turn prompts are insufficient for capturing the full range of potential harms.

* **Multi-Turn Dialogues:** Bias and harm can emerge and accumulate over the course of a conversation. A response that is benign in isolation may contribute to a harmful narrative over several turns. Therefore, benchmarks must evaluate fairness in a conversational context. The **FairMT-Bench** provides a model for this, proposing a taxonomy for evaluating fairness across three stages of a multi-turn dialogue: context understanding, interaction fairness, and fairness trade-offs.67  
* **Task-Oriented Bias:** For an agentic system, bias is not limited to the text it generates but extends to the *actions* it takes or recommends. A benchmark must evaluate whether the agent's task-oriented behaviors are equitable. For example, does a job-searching agent recommend different types of roles based on inferred gender or race? Does a financial advice agent offer different strategies based on socioeconomic cues?  
* **Intersectional Biases:** Social bias rarely operates along a single axis. Benchmarks must move beyond evaluating gender bias or racial bias in isolation and test for **intersectional biases**, where harms are directed at individuals at the intersection of multiple identity categories (e.g., race × gender, or nationality × socioeconomic status). The **VLBiasBench** for vision-language models provides a strong precedent, systematically constructing a dataset to evaluate nine distinct categories of social bias and two intersectional categories.68 This approach is directly applicable and essential for extending beyond simple factual benchmarks.

### **5.3. A Proposed Framework for Benchmark Creation**

This section outlines a concrete, four-step framework for the development team to build a continuous benchmark generation pipeline. This pipeline will produce dynamic, adversarial test cases to rigorously probe the agent's alignment.

* **Step 1: Adversarial Prompt Generation.** Instead of relying solely on manual prompt creation, which is slow and limited in creativity, the system should leverage an **"attacker LLM"** to automatically generate a large and diverse corpus of adversarial prompts.69 This attacker LLM can be instructed to create prompts that are designed to elicit biased responses, test for stereotype reinforcement, or attempt to find loopholes in the agent's constitutional principles. Counterfactual pairs (e.g., changing a name from "John" to "Jamal") can be systematically generated to test for differential treatment. This method is highly scalable and can uncover subtle biases that human annotators might miss.  
* **Step 2: Multi-Turn Scenario Design.** The generated prompts should be embedded within realistic, multi-turn conversational scenarios modeled after the FairMT-Bench framework.67 These scenarios should be designed to test for bias accumulation and context-dependent fairness. Critically, these scenarios should also be designed to create  
  **normative conflicts**—pitting the agent's constitutional principles against each other (e.g., forcing a choice between being helpful and being harmless).4 Testing how the agent resolves these conflicts is a powerful way to assess the robustness of its alignment.  
* **Step 3: Intersectional Identity Representation.** Drawing from the methodology of VLBiasBench, the prompt and scenario generation process must be structured to ensure comprehensive coverage of intersectional identities.68 The system should not just test for "gender bias" but for bias against specific intersections, such as "older women of a specific race" or "young men from a lower socioeconomic background." This requires a systematic approach to creating identity profiles and generating prompts tailored to those profiles.  
* **Step 4: LLM-as-Judge Evaluation.** Given the scale of data generated by this pipeline, relying exclusively on human evaluation is impractical. The primary evaluation mechanism should be a powerful **"judge LLM"** (e.g., GPT-4), which is tasked with scoring the agent's responses against a detailed, constitution-based rubric.10 This judge can assess responses for bias, toxicity, stereotype reinforcement, and adherence to specific principles. While scalable, the judge LLM's performance must itself be validated through periodic human review and comparison to ensure its judgments are reliable and aligned with human intent.67

### **5.4. Evaluation Metrics: Measuring Neutrality, Bias Scores, and Real-World Harm**

The new benchmarks should employ a suite of sophisticated metrics that provide a nuanced view of the agent's behavior.

* **Neutrality and Bias Scores:** Adopt the quantitative metrics from the BBG framework. The **neutrality score (ntr\_gen)** measures the proportion of instances where the model generates a neutral or undetermined response when presented with an ambiguous, stereotype-relevant context. The **bias score (bias\_gen)** measures the degree to which the model's non-neutral responses align with social stereotypes versus countering them.64  
* **Refusal Rate vs. Harmfulness Score:** It is not enough to know if a model refuses a harmful request; it is crucial to know how harmful its response is when it fails to refuse. The evaluation should adopt metrics from red teaming frameworks like StrongREJECT, which separately measure:  
  * **Refusal Rate:** The percentage of times the model refuses to comply with a harmful or biased request.  
  * **Harmfulness Score:** For the instances where the model complies, a score assessing the specificity, actionability, and convincingness of the harmful or biased assistance it provides.49  
* **Uplift Studies:** To measure the real-world harm potential of the agent, the evaluation should include **uplift studies**.11 This methodology compares the performance of human testers on a potentially harmful or biased task  
  *with* and *without* the assistance of the AI agent. The key question is not just "Can the agent generate biased content?" but "Does the agent *enable* a user to achieve a biased or harmful outcome more quickly, more effectively, or on a larger scale than they could otherwise?" This measures the agent's differential impact, providing a much more realistic assessment of its risk profile.

| Benchmark Name | Core Methodology | Target Bias/Harm | Task Format | Key Limitation |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **TruthfulQA** | Question-answering on topics prone to human misconceptions.10 | Misinformation, falsehoods. | QA (Multiple Choice) | Does not measure open-ended generation or social biases. |
| **ToxiGen** | Adversarial generation of implicitly toxic statements about minority groups.10 | Implicit hate speech, nuanced toxicity. | Classification / QA | Focuses on toxicity, less on broader social or allocational biases. |
| **HHH** | Human preference evaluation of paired model responses.10 | Unhelpfulness, dishonesty, harmfulness. | Preference Pairs | Relies on subjective human judgment, can be expensive to scale. |
| **BBQ** | Multiple-choice QA in ambiguous, stereotype-relevant contexts.64 | Stereotypical social biases (gender, race, etc.). | QA (Multiple Choice) | QA performance does not correlate with generative bias.64 |
| **BBG** | Long-form story generation from obfuscated BBQ contexts.64 | Stereotypical social biases in open-ended generation. | Generation | Requires adaptation of existing QA datasets; less focused on dialogue. |
| **VLBiasBench** | Image-based QA with prompts covering nine social and two intersectional biases.68 | Intersectional bias (e.g., race × gender, race × SES). | Visual QA | Focused on vision-language models, needs adaptation for text-only agents. |
| **FairMT-Bench** | Multi-turn dialogue scenarios testing fairness at different conversational stages.67 | Bias accumulation, context-dependent fairness in dialogue. | Multi-turn Dialogue | Computationally expensive to evaluate due to multi-turn nature.67 |

## **Section 6: Strategic Implementation Roadmap and Recommendations**

This final section synthesizes the preceding analysis into a coherent, actionable strategy for the organization. It provides a high-level, phased implementation plan, recommends integrating the technical framework into a formal governance process for continuous assurance, and outlines key considerations for future-proofing the system against evolving threats. The overarching recommendation is to treat AI safety not as a one-time project, but as a continuous, institutionalized practice that is integral to the entire AI lifecycle.

### **6.1. Phased Implementation Plan**

A structured, phased approach is recommended to manage the complexity of developing and integrating the full Ethical AI and Alignment Framework.

* **Phase 1: Foundational Scaffolding (Months 1-3)**  
  * **Task 1: Establish an AI Safety Council.** Assemble a multi-disciplinary team comprising senior engineers, AI researchers, ethicists, legal experts, and product managers. This council will be responsible for overseeing the development of the constitution and making key policy decisions.60  
  * **Task 2: Draft Constitution v1.0.** Using the C3AI framework detailed in Section 4, the council will lead the process of item selection, transformation, and principle selection to create the first version of the system constitution.55 The focus should be on establishing core principles for harmlessness and fairness.  
  * **Task 3: Deploy Baseline Guardrails.** Implement initial input and output guardrails to address the most critical, low-hanging risks. This should include using off-the-shelf models or services for detecting obvious toxicity, filtering PII, and blocking known harmful topics.17 This provides an immediate layer of protection while more sophisticated components are developed.  
* **Phase 2: Core Component Development (Months 4-9)**  
  * **Task 1: Build the 'Ethics & Alignment' Safeguard Agent.** Architect and build the parallel safeguard agent as described in Section 3\. This includes implementing the monitoring capabilities and intervention authority, potentially using a "Safeguard-by-Development" pattern like Maris.37  
  * **Task 2: Implement the Constitution-Driven RLAIF Pipeline.** Re-architect the existing RLAIF loop to incorporate the constitution-based feedback mechanism (RLCAI) as detailed in Section 4.4. The primary goal is to begin training a new preference model that is explicitly aligned with the v1.0 constitution.61  
  * **Task 3: Develop the Bias Benchmark Generation Pipeline v1.0.** Build the automated pipeline for generating social bias benchmarks, as outlined in Section 5.3. This involves setting up the "attacker LLM" and "judge LLM" and beginning the generation of multi-turn, intersectional test cases.69  
* **Phase 3: Integration, Testing, and Iteration (Months 10-12+)**  
  * **Task 1: System-Wide Integration.** Integrate the safeguard agent, the constitution-aligned core model, and the baseline guardrails into a single, cohesive system.  
  * **Task 2: Conduct Adversarial Evaluation.** Perform extensive, large-scale testing of the integrated system. This involves deploying the new bias benchmark pipeline and conducting structured red teaming exercises to identify remaining vulnerabilities and test the effectiveness of the safeguard agent.45  
  * **Task 3: Institute a Continuous Improvement Loop.** Establish a formal process for using the results from testing to drive system improvements. This includes iteratively refining the constitution, updating the policies of the guardrail and safeguard agents, and using newly discovered failure modes as data for the next round of model fine-tuning.

### **6.2. Continuous Assurance: Integrating with a Lifecycle Framework**

To ensure that safety is managed systematically and accountably over time, the technical framework should be embedded within a formal governance process. The **MITRE AI Assurance Framework** is a highly suitable model for this purpose. It provides a repeatable, lifecycle-oriented process for discovering, assessing, and managing risk.71

The MITRE framework consists of three main phases: **Prepare for Assurance, Establish Assurance, and Maintain Assurance**.73 The artifacts produced by the recommendations in this report map directly onto the "evidence" required to build an "assurance case" within this framework:

* The **System Constitution** serves as the explicit statement of the system's intended ethical behavior.  
* The **Benchmark Results** and **Red Teaming Reports** provide empirical evidence of the system's performance against safety and fairness criteria.  
* The **Audit Logs** from the guardrail and safeguard agents provide a continuous record of in-production performance and policy compliance.

By adopting such a framework, the organization can create a living **AI Assurance Plan**—a comprehensive document that outlines all activities, evidence, and risk management strategies necessary to maintain confidence in the system's safety and effectiveness over its entire operational lifetime.73 This provides a structured mechanism for demonstrating due diligence to internal stakeholders, customers, and regulators.

### **6.3. Future-Proofing the System: Adapting to Evolving Threats**

The work of securing AI systems is never complete.46 The threat landscape and model capabilities will continue to evolve, requiring a proactive strategy for maintaining the framework's effectiveness.

* **Automated Red Teaming:** The manual and semi-automated benchmark generation process should evolve into a fully **automated red teaming** capability. This involves creating dedicated "red teaming agents" whose purpose is to continuously and autonomously attack the production system to discover new weaknesses.51 This transitions the evaluation process from a periodic activity to a 24/7, machine-speed endeavor.  
* **Data-Centric Alignment:** The organization must recognize the critical role of data in maintaining alignment over time. This involves establishing practices for **dynamic and longitudinal preference collection** to counteract the "temporal drift" of human values and societal norms.75 The feedback data used for alignment must be continuously refreshed and re-evaluated for quality and representativeness to ensure the AI does not become aligned with outdated or biased information.75  
* **Monitoring Future Research Directions:** The AI Safety Council should be tasked with actively monitoring and integrating findings from key AI safety research areas. Critical directions to watch include:  
  * **Understanding Model Cognition:** Research into what models are "thinking," including their plans, goals, and situational awareness, will be crucial for detecting more sophisticated forms of misalignment like deception.77  
  * **Developing Adaptive Defenses:** Future guardrails will need to be adaptive, monitoring sets of queries over time to infer high-level malicious intent rather than just reacting to individual prompts.77  
  * **Formalizing Normative Reasoning:** The ultimate goal is to move beyond shallow alignment to systems that can perform genuine normative deliberation. Research into this area will be key to building truly robust and resiliently aligned AI.3

### **6.4. Concluding Recommendations**

To address the identified ethical and alignment gaps, this report provides a comprehensive blueprint for action. The strategy is synthesized into four primary recommendations:

1. **Adopt a Defense-in-Depth Architecture:** Implement a multi-layered guardrail system composed of input, output, and system-level checks. This system should be architected as an external orchestration layer, managed by a dedicated, parallel **"Ethics & Alignment" safeguard agent** that provides continuous, real-time monitoring and enforcement.  
2. **Make Alignment Explicit with a Constitution:** Utilize a rigorous methodology like the **C3AI framework** to develop a formal, machine-readable system constitution. This constitution must serve as the single, authoritative source of truth for ethical principles, providing the critique rubric for the Evaluator agent, the policy basis for the safeguard agent, and the guiding framework for the RLAIF preference model.  
3. **Embrace Adversarial Evaluation:** Transition from static benchmarking to a **dynamic, continuous benchmark generation pipeline**. This pipeline should use automated and adversarial techniques to constantly create novel, multi-turn, and intersectional test cases that actively probe for vulnerabilities and measure real-world harm potential.  
4. **Institutionalize Safety and Governance:** Embed this entire technical framework within a formal, lifecycle-spanning governance process, such as the **MITRE AI Assurance Framework**. This institutionalizes safety as a continuous practice of risk management, evidence gathering, and accountability, ensuring the system remains trustworthy and aligned with human values as it evolves.
