# Research Directory

This folder contains proposals and deep-dive studies that guide future development. Documents are named using the pattern `YEAR-slug.md` where the slug is lowercase and hyphen separated.

## Naming Conventions
- Use `YYYY` to denote the expected year of adoption.
- Replace spaces with hyphens and avoid capitalization in filenames.
