# Epic: Security Architecture Enhancement

This epic consolidates change requests aimed at strengthening the system's defense-in-depth strategy. It aligns with the security workstream described in [BLUEPRINT.md](../../BLUEPRINT.md) and incorporates insights from the Red Team Agent research.

## Objectives
- Harden the Evaluator agent with memory-augmented reasoning and secure APIs.
- Deploy a dedicated Security Agent for real-time trust management.
- Defend Long-Term Memory (LTM) against retrieval-based poisoning attacks.
- Enforce secure architectural patterns and communication protocols.

## Change Requests

### P2-05: Memory-Augmented Evaluator
- **AgentAuditor framework** – store prior risk cases and retrieve them via RAG for contextual judgment【F:docs/research/2025-dynamic-trust-reputation-system.md†L190-L211】.
- **Secure API authentication** – use OAuth tokens for all Evaluator calls, as required for event-driven reputation feedback【F:docs/research/2025-dynamic-trust-reputation-system.md†L190-L211】.

### P3-02: Dedicated Security Agent
- **Dynamic credibility scoring** – compute reputation vectors in real time and weight agent output accordingly【F:docs/research/2025-dynamic-trust-reputation-system.md†L149-L158】.
- **Anomaly monitoring** – watch inter-agent traffic for suspicious patterns; communication must remain LLM-grounded for auditability【F:docs/architecture/llm_grounded_guided_evolution.md†L1-L11】.

### P2-01: LTM Hardening
- **Source credibility verification** – evaluate the trustworthiness of new data before ingestion【F:docs/research/2025-agent-introspection-toolkit.md†L51-L63】.
- **Retrieval-time filtering** – inspect documents after retrieval to block AGENTPOISON-style payloads【F:docs/reports/phase2-security-audit-report.md†L39-L52】.
- **Continuous anomaly detection** – monitor the embedding space for semantic outliers that may indicate poisoning.

### Architecture Patterns
- **Dual LLM pattern** – quarantine untrusted inputs from privileged operations【F:docs/architecture/llm_grounded_guided_evolution.md†L1-L11】.
- **LLM-grounded protocols** – strictly disallow fully emergent languages to avoid covert channels【F:docs/architecture/llm_grounded_guided_evolution.md†L1-L11】.
- **Data provenance tracking** – integrate ML-BOM style provenance across the memory pipeline.

## Next Steps
Each change request will be logged in the change request ledger and broken down into tasks within `codex_tasks.md`. Engineering and QA teams should prioritize implementation according to the threat level outlined in the Red Team Agent report.
