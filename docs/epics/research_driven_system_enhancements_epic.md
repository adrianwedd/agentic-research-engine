Apply the reconciliation protocol to resolve conflicting facts before retrieval. Formal adjudication ensures a consistent KG【F:docs/research/2025-automated-knowledge-graph-reconciliation-and-synthesis.md†L13-L25】.

### RE-03 Migrate to Rainbow Deployments for Stateful Agents
Extend blue-green deployments to multiple versions for safer rollouts.

### RE-04 Implement Computational Economy for Multi-Agent Resource Allocation
Introduce an auction-based scheduler to allocate CPU and memory budgets efficiently.

### RE-05 Add Counterfactual-Driven Planning Module
Use counterfactual reasoning to explore alternative action sequences before execution【F:docs/research/2025-counterfactual-driven-planning.md†L44-L56】.

### RE-06 Enable Cross-Lingual Knowledge-Graph Support
Add translation and alignment layers so queries work across languages【F:docs/research/2025-cross-lingual-knowledge-graphs.md†L21-L37】.

### RE-07 Deploy Differential-Privacy LTM Architecture
Apply DP mechanisms such as calibrated noise addition on memory writes【F:docs/research/2025-dp-ltm-architecture.md†L7-L18】.

### RE-08 Build Dynamic Trust & Reputation Subsystem
Track agent performance with vector-based scores for smarter task assignment【F:docs/research/2025-dynamic-trust-reputation-system.md†L23-L31】.

### RE-09 Secure Emergent Communication Channels
Sandbox agent interactions and enforce LLM-grounded protocols【F:docs/research/2025-emergent-communication-report.md†L1-L10】【F:docs/research/2025-emergent-communication-report.md†L170-L170】.

### RE-10 Integrate Formal Verification into Workflow Graphs
Fail CI when workflows violate safety properties using model checking.

### RE-11 Optimize Graph Compilation for Agent Workflows
Precompile workflows into efficient DAGs, reducing runtime overhead【F:docs/research/2025-graph-compilation.md†L10-L23】.

### RE-12 Extend LTM with Forgetting & Consolidation Strategies
Consolidate high-value memories and prune stale entries to prevent bloat【F:docs/research/2025-ltm-forgetting-study.md†L1-L15】.

### RE-13 Support Multi-Modal Memory Integration
Index and retrieve embeddings for images and code alongside text【F:docs/research/2025-multi-modal-memory-integration.md†L1-L20】.

### RE-14 Generalize Procedural Memory Skills Across Contexts
Adapt past workflows to new parameters using similarity metrics【F:docs/research/2025-procedural-memory-skill-generalization.md†L5-L12】.

### RE-15 Harden Retrieval Against Poisoning: Red-Team-Agent Defenses
Filter adversarial documents to shield RAG pipelines from poisoning【F:docs/research/2025-red-team-agent.md†L1-L10】.

### RE-16 Introduce Reward-Shaping Functions for RL-Based Agents
Use shaping formulas to guide RL agents toward safer behaviors【F:docs/research/2025-score-reward-shaping.md†L1-L10】.

### RE-17 Incorporate Spatio-Temporal Metadata in Memory Indexing
Tag memories with timestamps and session IDs to weight recency【F:docs/research/2025-spatio-temporal-memory.md†L9-L22】.

### RE-18 Pipeline for Synthetic Self-Correction Data Generation
Generate training pairs of flawed outputs and corrections automatically【F:docs/research/2025-synthetic-data-research.md†L3-L17】.

### RE-19 Embed Transfer-Generalization Metrics in Evaluation Dashboard
Expose new metrics in the monitoring UI to gauge cross-domain skill transfer【F:docs/research/2025-transfer-generalization-metrics.md†L1-L10】.

## Next Steps
1. Prioritize security-related CRs such as RE-07, RE-09, and RE-15.
2. Break down high-effort items into sub-tasks via grooming sessions.
3. Assign owners and schedule target sprints.
