# README Review: Content Structure & Clarity

This report details the findings and recommendations regarding the content structure and clarity of the main `README.md` file.

## 1. Findings

### 1.1. Headings Hierarchy

*   **Overall:** The heading structure generally follows a logical progression (H1 → H2 → H3).
*   **H1:** A single H1 is used for the main title: `# **agentic-research-engine: A Self-Improving Multi-Agent Research System**`.
*   **H2:** Sections like `## **1. Vision & Mission**` are used for top-level sections. The numbering and double asterisks (`**X.**`) are stylistic.
*   **H3:** Subsections like `### **Prerequisites**` and `### **PDF Reader Tool**` are correctly nested under H2s.
*   **Inconsistencies:** No major inconsistencies or skipped levels were found.

### 1.2. Section Completeness

*   **Introduction:** **Present** (as "Vision & Mission"). Content appears adequate.
*   **Prerequisites:** **Present** (as a subsection under "Getting Started"). Content appears adequate.
*   **Installation:** **Present** (as part of "Development Setup" under "Getting Started"). Content appears adequate.
*   **Usage:** **Present** (covered by "System Workflow Example," "Repository Structure," and "Running Tests"). Content provides a good overview.
*   **Configuration:** **Partially Present.** While there's a step for `.env` configuration under "Development Setup," a dedicated "Configuration" section is missing. This section could elaborate on key environment variables, common configuration options, or link to more detailed configuration documentation if available.
*   **Contributing:** **Present.** Content appears adequate.
*   **License:** **Present.** Content appears adequate.
*   **Support:** **Missing.** There is no dedicated section outlining how users or contributors can get support, report issues (other than through PRs for contributions), or ask questions.

### 1.3. Conciseness & Tone

*   **Plain Language:** The language is professional but highly technical and dense with project-specific terms and advanced AI/ML concepts (e.g., "LangGraph," "RLAIF," "MAST-based failure testing"). While suitable for experts, it may pose a barrier to those less familiar with these specific technologies or the project's internal lexicon.
*   **Active Voice:** The README predominantly uses active voice, which enhances clarity.
*   **Consistent Terminology:** Key terms and agent names (e.g., "Supervisor," "LTM," "Episodic Memory") are used consistently throughout the document.

## 2. Recommendations

### 2.1. Headings Hierarchy

*   **Recommendation 1 (Low Priority):** Consider removing the manual numbering (e.g., "1.", "2.") from H2 headings if the rendered output on platforms like GitHub automatically provides numbering or if a table of contents is used. This is a minor stylistic point.

### 2.2. Section Completeness

*   **Recommendation 2 (High Priority):** Add a dedicated "## Configuration" section.
    *   **Action:** This section should detail important environment variables, explain their purpose and possible values, and describe any other critical configuration files or settings. If extensive, it could link to a more detailed page in `/docs`.
*   **Recommendation 3 (High Priority):** Add a dedicated "## Support" (or "## Getting Help") section.
    *   **Action:** This section should guide users on how to ask questions, report bugs (e.g., via GitHub Issues, if enabled and monitored), or seek other forms of support. Include links to any community channels if they exist (e.g., Discord, Slack, mailing list).

### 2.3. Conciseness & Tone

*   **Recommendation 4 (Medium Priority):** Improve approachability for a broader audience.
    *   **Action:** For specialized terms or acronyms (e.g., "LangGraph," "RLAIF," "BrowseComp," "MAST"), provide brief inline explanations, tooltips (if Markdown extensions support them), or links to sections in `/docs` or external resources that define them. This will be further detailed in the `readability.md` report.
    *   **Action:** Review dense paragraphs for opportunities to simplify sentence structure or break them into more digestible points, especially in the "Core Architectural Pillars" and "System Workflow Example" sections.
