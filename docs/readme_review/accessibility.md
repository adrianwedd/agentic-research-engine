# README Review: Accessibility Audit

This report details the findings and recommendations from the accessibility audit of the main `README.md` file.

## 1. Findings

### 1.1. Alt Text for Images/Badges

*   **Badges:**
    *   `[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen)](https://github.com/actions)`: Alt text is "Build Status". **Finding:** Adequate.
    *   `[![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-86%25-brightgreen)](https://codecov.io)`: Alt text is "Coverage". **Finding:** Adequate.
    *   `[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)`: Alt text is "License: MIT". **Finding:** Adequate.
*   **Other Images:** No other images were identified in the `README.md` file.

### 1.2. Link Text

*   **Overall:** Link texts are generally descriptive and clearly indicate the destination or purpose of the link (e.g., `[BLUEPRINT.md](BLUEPRINT.md)`, `[docs/onboarding.md](docs/onboarding.md)`).
*   **"LICENSE" Link:** The link `[LICENSE](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)` has "LICENSE" as text. While generally understood in context, it could be slightly more descriptive (e.g., "MIT License details").
*   **Vague Links:** No instances of overly vague link texts like "click here" or "read more" were found.

### 1.3. Code Blocks & Syntax Highlighting

*   **General Usage:** Inline code is correctly demarcated with single backticks. Fenced code blocks (triple backticks) are used for multi-line code snippets.
*   **Language Identifiers:**
    *   Many `bash` script examples are correctly identified (e.g., ` ```bash`).
    *   The repository structure diagram ` ``` / ... ``` ` appropriately has no language identifier (or could use `text`).
    *   **Issue:** Some shell command blocks are missing a language identifier (e.g., `bash` or `sh`), which may result in improper syntax highlighting and screen reader annunciation. Examples:
        *   ` ``` python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate ``` `
        *   ` ``` poetry run pytest tests/unit/ ``` `
        *   ` ``` poetry run pytest tests/integration/ ``` `
        *   ` ``` poetry run python -m tests.run_benchmark --benchmark=browsecomp_v1 ``` `

### 1.4. Lists & Tables

*   **Lists:** Numbered lists are used correctly and follow proper Markdown syntax, contributing to good structure.
*   **Tables:** No complex data tables are present in the `README.md`.

### 1.5. Contrast & Badges (Manual Assessment)

*   **Shields.io Badges:**
    *   `build-passing-brightgreen`: White text on bright green. Appears to have sufficient contrast.
    *   `coverage-86%-brightgreen`: White text on bright green. Appears to have sufficient contrast.
    *   `license-MIT-blue.svg`: White text on blue. Appears to have sufficient contrast.
*   **Note:** This is a manual visual assessment. For rigorous WCAG AA compliance, an automated contrast checking tool should be used on the rendered badges.

### 1.6. Keyboard Navigation & Focus States (Conceptual Review)

*   **Headings:** The existing heading structure (H1, H2, H3) provides a good semantic foundation for keyboard navigation and screen reader interpretation when rendered by GitHub.
*   **Links & Interactive Elements:** Links are the primary interactive elements. Their descriptive text aids navigation.
*   **Overall Structure:** The Markdown structure appears conducive to logical tab order and focus states in a rendered GitHub page. No obvious Markdown-level anti-patterns were identified that would impede this.

## 2. Recommendations

### 2.1. Alt Text for Images/Badges

*   No immediate recommendations. Current alt texts are adequate.

### 2.2. Link Text

*   **Recommendation 1 (Very Low Priority):** For the `[LICENSE](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)` link, consider changing the text to "View MIT License" or "MIT License details" for minor clarity improvement. This is not critical.

### 2.3. Code Blocks & Syntax Highlighting

*   **Recommendation 2 (Medium Priority):** Add appropriate language identifiers to all shell command code blocks.
    *   **Action:** For consistency and proper rendering, change blocks like:
        ` ``` python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate ``` `
        to
        ` ```bash python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate ``` `
    *   **Action:** Similarly, update other shell command blocks:
        *   ` ```bash poetry run pytest tests/unit/ ``` `
        *   ` ```bash poetry run pytest tests/integration/ ``` `
        *   ` ```bash poetry run python -m tests.run_benchmark --benchmark=browsecomp_v1 ``` `

### 2.4. Lists & Tables

*   No recommendations. Current usage is good.

### 2.5. Contrast & Badges

*   **Recommendation 3 (Low Priority):** If practical, use an automated tool to verify that the specific color combinations used in badges (e.g., by shields.io) meet WCAG AA contrast ratios. However, the default badges used appear to be common and generally accessible.

### 2.6. Keyboard Navigation & Focus States

*   No specific recommendations based on Markdown structure. Continue to ensure logical heading order and descriptive links in future updates.
