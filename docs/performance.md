# Performance Enhancements

The Episodic Memory service uses an in-memory LRU cache to avoid generating embeddings for identical text chunks multiple times. The cache size is controlled via the `EMBED_CACHE_SIZE` environment variable.

## Configuration

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `EMBED_CACHE_SIZE` | Maximum number of distinct text chunks to cache for embeddings. Set to `0` to disable caching. | `0` |
| `VECTOR_SEARCH_WORKERS` | Number of worker processes to use for similarity search in the in-memory vector store. Set to `1` for serial execution. | `1` |

A larger cache improves retrieval latency at the cost of additional memory. With a cache size of 512 entries, we observed roughly a 15% reduction in P95 retrieval latency in the local benchmark.

Parallel vector search can further improve throughput on multi-core hosts. Adjust `VECTOR_SEARCH_WORKERS` based on available CPU cores. On an 8â€‘core machine, using 4 workers yielded around a 30% increase in requests per second compared to the single-worker baseline.
