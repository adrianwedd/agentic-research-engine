# Test Coverage Audit

This document outlines the findings of the test coverage analysis for the repository.

## 1. Methodology

Test coverage was assessed using `pytest` with the `pytest-cov` plugin. The goal was to determine the percentage of code lines executed by the automated test suite and identify areas with insufficient test coverage.

## 2. Coverage Report

The CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) is configured to generate test coverage reports using `pytest --cov --cov-report=xml --cov-report=html` and uploads these as artifacts (`coverage.xml` and `htmlcov/`). The CI also runs the `scripts/ci_summary.py` script, which calculates and displays the coverage percentage in the GitHub Actions run summary.

**Due to environment limitations (specifically, "No space left on device" errors encountered when trying to install dependencies to run `pytest --cov` in the current environment), this audit could not independently regenerate the coverage report.**

**Action Required:** Please retrieve the latest test coverage percentage and review the detailed HTML coverage report from the most recent successful CI run on the `main` branch.
    *   The overall coverage percentage can be found in the GitHub Actions run summary for the `CI` workflow.
    *   The detailed HTML report (`htmlcov/`) can be downloaded as an artifact from the same CI run.

Please use this information to fill in the "Analysis of Coverage" section below.

## 3. Analysis of Coverage

*(Please populate the following based on the latest CI coverage report.)*
*(This section will include a qualitative analysis of the coverage report, highlighting key areas with low coverage and potential reasons or implications.)*

*   **Overall Coverage Percentage:** [Data unavailable due to test execution failure]
*   **Untested/Undertested Modules:**
    *   [Data unavailable due to test execution failure]
*   **Observations:**
    *   [Data unavailable due to test execution failure]

## 4. Flaky Tests

*(This section is for noting any known or suspected flaky tests. This often requires historical data or manual observation over time. For this initial audit, we will note it as an area for ongoing monitoring unless specific flaky tests are already known or easily identifiable from recent CI runs.)*

*   No specific flaky tests were identified during this audit pass without deeper CI log analysis. This area should be monitored continuously.

## 5. Recommendations

*   **Resolve Environment Issues:** The immediate priority is to resolve the "No space left on device" error in the execution environment to enable test runs and dependency installation.
*   **Install Dependencies:** Once the environment is fixed, ensure all project and test dependencies are installed correctly. A `requirements.txt` or similar mechanism should be robust.
*   **Increase Coverage:** Prioritize writing tests for critical modules/files identified with low coverage (once data is available). Aim to increase overall coverage to [target percentage, e.g., 80-90%], focusing on untested business logic and error handling.
*   **Address Test Gaps:** Systematically review modules with low coverage (once data is available) and develop a plan to add missing unit and integration tests.
*   **Flaky Test Management:** Implement a strategy for identifying, tracking, and fixing flaky tests if they become apparent. This might involve more detailed CI reporting or specific tools.
*   **Coverage Thresholds:** Consider enforcing coverage thresholds in the CI pipeline (e.g., using `--cov-fail-under=X`) to prevent coverage from degrading over time. (Note: `--cov-fail-under=0` was used for this audit to gather data without failing the run).
