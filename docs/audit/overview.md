# Repository Audit Overview

## 1. Objectives

This document summarizes the findings of a comprehensive repository audit. The primary objectives of this audit were to:

*   Identify and surface hidden technical debt.
*   Assess and pinpoint security vulnerabilities and gaps.
*   Evaluate the current state of documentation and identify blind spots.
*   Ensure the repository remains maintainable, secure, and onboarding-friendly for future contributors and stakeholders.
*   Provide a living artifact that guides future development and improvements.

## 2. Methodology

The audit was conducted by systematically reviewing several key areas of the repository. The scope included:

*   **Code Quality:** Assessing code for linting errors, complexity, and adherence to best practices.
*   **Test Coverage:** Analyzing the extent and effectiveness of automated tests.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Reviewing the continuous integration and continuous delivery pipeline for correctness, efficiency, and reliability.
*   **Dependencies:** Examining third-party packages for known vulnerabilities and license compliance.
*   **Security Posture:** Performing a review for common security weaknesses, secret management, and access controls.
*   **Documentation Coverage:** Evaluating the completeness and accuracy of existing project documentation.

Detailed findings for each of these areas are available in their respective markdown files within this `/docs/audit/` directory.
