# Governance Process

This repository uses a lightweight governance model centered on an **AI Safety Council**. The council drafts and approves the system constitution stored at the repository root as `constitution.yaml`.

## Constitution Management

1. Proposed changes to the constitution are submitted as pull requests.
2. Each proposal must include rationale and be approved by a majority of the council.
3. Approved versions are tagged and referenced in pipeline metadata.

## Change Requests

All major architectural or policy updates are tracked as change requests in `docs/change_request_ledger.md`. Contributors open a CR with the proposed modification and the council reviews it during scheduled meetings.

## Reward Model Alignment

Training pipelines consume the active constitution to generate selfâ€‘critique scores and preference labels. Metadata for each reward model release records the constitution version used so future audits can reproduce training conditions.
