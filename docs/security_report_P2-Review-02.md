# Security Review Report: P2-Review-02

This document summarizes the results of a lightweight security review of the repository. The review followed the steps outlined in the Codex task P2-Review-02.

## Dependency Vulnerability Scan

`pip-audit` was attempted on `requirements.txt` but failed to complete within the execution environment. The generated report (`pip_audit_report.txt`) is empty. No vulnerability breakdown is available.

## Input Handling Review

We manually inspected the Supervisor agent and tool wrappers for handling of user inputs:

- `agents/supervisor.py` validates that the query is a non-empty string before processing.
- `tools/pdf_reader.py` sanitizes URLs using `urlparse` and checks for OCR fallback, but relies on user provided paths/URLs without further validation.
- `tools/html_scraper.py` and `tools/web_search.py` validate response status codes and check for empty inputs.

No explicit injection vulnerabilities were discovered, although tighter input validation (e.g., allowed URL schemes) is recommended.

## Secret Management

Searches for hard‑coded credentials found no API keys or passwords in the codebase. The tooling expects credentials from environment variables (e.g., `SEARCH_API_KEY`, `FACT_CHECK_API_KEY`).

## RBAC Enforcement Testing

`tests/test_tool_registry.py::test_registry_authorization` was executed. The test confirms that only authorized roles can access registered tools.

## Security Scorecard

| Category | Count |
| --- | --- |
| Critical vulnerabilities | N/A (scan failed) |
| High vulnerabilities | N/A |
| Medium vulnerabilities | N/A |
| Low vulnerabilities | N/A |
| Input handling issues | 0 critical issues found |
| Secrets exposures | 0 found |
| RBAC lapses | 0 found (based on test) |

## Change Requests

1. **Integrate automated dependency scanning** – add a CI job running `pip-audit` (or Snyk) to detect known vulnerabilities early. *Urgency: High*
2. **Validate file and URL inputs** – implement whitelisting of URL schemes and path sanitization in `pdf_extract` and `html_scraper` to reduce injection risks. *Urgency: Medium*
3. **Document secrets management** – provide guidance in the README for storing API keys in a secret manager rather than environment variables when deployed. *Urgency: Medium*
4. **Expand RBAC logging** – record failed authorization attempts in `ToolRegistryServer` for auditability. *Urgency: Low*
5. **Monitor third‑party package updates** – create a monthly process to update dependencies and re-run the audit. *Urgency: Low*
