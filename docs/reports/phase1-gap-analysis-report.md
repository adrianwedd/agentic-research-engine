# Phase 1 Gap Analysis

This document reviews the repository state against the Phase 1 change requests (P1‑01 … P1‑20). Each row summarises whether the implementation fully satisfies the refined CR or if additional work is required.

| CR | Title | Status |
|----|-------|--------|
| P1-01 | Mono-repo setup, branch protection & pre-commit hooks | ⚠ Partial – pre-commit configured, branch protection assumed but cannot be verified from repo |
| P1-02 | CI pipeline with caching & parallel jobs | ✔ Implemented |
| P1-03 | CD pipeline with rainbow deployment | ✔ Implemented |
| P1-04 | OpenTelemetry collector deployment | ✔ Implemented |
| P1-05 | Core agent tracing schema | ✔ Implemented |
| P1-06 | Orchestration engine with graph execution | ✔ Implemented |
| P1-07 | Central State object | ✔ Implemented |
| P1-08 | Conditional edge routing | ✔ Implemented |
| P1-09 | Supervisor agent query ingestion | ✔ Implemented |
| P1-10 | Supervisor planning output format | ✔ Implemented |
| P1-11 | WebResearcher agent tool usage | ✔ Implemented |
| P1-12 | WebResearcher summarization | ✔ Implemented |
| P1-13 | Tool Registry with RBAC | ✔ Implemented |
| P1-14 | Web Search tool wrapper | ✔ Implemented |
| P1-15 | PDF Reader tool wrapper | ✔ Implemented |
| P1-16 | HTML Scraper tool wrapper | ✔ Implemented |
| P1-17 | BrowseComp dataset (>50 items) | ✔ Implemented |
| P1-18 | Integration-test harness | ✔ Implemented |
| P1-19 | Unit test framework & coverage enforcement | ⚠ Partial – tests exist but coverage threshold not enforced in CI |
| P1-20 | Graph compilation strategies research | ✔ Implemented |

## Follow-up Change Requests

The following CRs are proposed to close the remaining gaps and strengthen Phase 1 deliverables:

1. **CR: Enforce branch protection & pre-commit compliance**
   - Configure repository settings to block direct pushes to `main` and require passing CI checks and one approved review.
   - Document the policy in the contributor guide.
2. **CR: Enforce coverage threshold in CI**
   - Integrate `pytest-cov` and add a minimum coverage check (>=80%) to the CI workflow.
3. **CR: Expand tracing to cover state transitions**
   - Review spans emitted for orchestration edges and agent state updates; ensure all follow the schema in `docs/tracing_schema.md`.
4. **CR: Validate Supervisor plan output with schema**
   - Add strict schema validation for the YAML plan emitted by the Supervisor agent.
5. **CR: Harden PDF Reader wrapper**
   - Improve error handling for scanned PDFs; add optional OCR fallback tests.
6. **CR: Enhance integration harness**
   - Increase timeout configurability and handle partial failures gracefully.

These items should be prioritized to fully satisfy Phase 1 requirements and prepare for future phases.
