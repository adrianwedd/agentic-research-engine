# Phase 3 E2E Test Report

This report summarizes the end-to-end (E2E) tests executed for Phase 3 capabilities.

## Scenario 1: Collaborative Code Analysis
- **Objective:** Validate that multiple agents collaborate via the group chat to analyze code.
- **Result:** All dynamic group chat tests passed, confirming message passing, shared workspace updates, and scratchpad integration.
- **Metrics:** 3 tests, 0 failures.
- **Observation:** No unexpected communication behaviors were observed.

## Scenario 2: Knowledge-Augmented Research
- **Objective:** Ensure semantic memory is leveraged when planning.
- **Result:** Memory manager semantic retrieval tests succeeded.
- **Metrics:** 2 tests, 0 failures.
- **Observation:** Deprecation warnings for `datetime.utcnow()` were logged; a task has been opened to address this.

## Scenario 3: RLAIF Loop Dry Run
- **Objective:** Verify the reinforcement learning pipeline executes without errors.
- **Result:** RLAIF system tests passed including PPO update logic.
- **Metrics:** 3 tests, 0 failures.

### Integration Harness
A quick run of the BrowseComp integration harness with a dummy echo agent produced a 0% pass rate as expected. Average response time was under 1ms.

## Reward Model Baseline
No deviations were observed during reward model pipeline tests. The model successfully produced scores for the holdout set.
