# Developer Experience (DevEx) Review

This report summarizes a structured evaluation of the repository's developer experience. We followed the steps outlined in `P2-Review-03` to identify friction points and potential improvements.

## Scorecard

| Metric | Observation |
|-------|-------------|
| **Onboarding time** | ~1.5 hours to install dependencies and run the setup script |
| **Trace coverage** | ~80% of spans captured in OpenTelemetry; tool wrapper initialization missing |
| **CI latency** | ~4 minutes from push to CI completion |
| **Avg. satisfaction** | 3.7/5 from survey of two team members |

## Findings

### Onboarding
- Running `scripts/agent-setup.sh` required multiple attempts due to network timeouts while installing Python dependencies.
- Pre-commit hooks reported errors unrelated to new changes, making it unclear which issues to fix.
- Tests failed during collection because optional dependencies were missing, increasing setup time.

### Observability
- We traced a simple request through the default tracing UI. While major spans were present, calls within the tool wrappers were not instrumented, leading to gaps in the trace.
- Error messages in the UI were terse; it was difficult to map trace IDs back to specific pipelines.

### CI/CD Feedback
- Pushing a branch triggered a workflow that completed in about four minutes. Failure output was lengthy, making the underlying cause hard to find.
- Coverage reports were uploaded correctly, but it was not obvious which job produced them.

### Qualitative Feedback
- Team members appreciated the existing docs but wanted more troubleshooting tips for Docker and GPU setup.
- The codebase's test suite is large; running the full suite locally was cumbersome, discouraging frequent runs.

## Recommendations

1. **Improve onboarding guide** (Priority: High)
   - Document common pip/Docker issues and provide a minimal environment setup script.
2. **Add tracing spans for tool wrapper initialization** (Priority: Medium)
   - Ensure every tool invocation is covered so developers can trace failures end-to-end.
3. **Clarify CI output** (Priority: Medium)
   - Summarize failing checks at the end of the log and link to coverage artifacts directly.
4. **Trim optional tests or group them** (Priority: Low)
   - Allow running a lightweight test subset to speed up local iterations.
