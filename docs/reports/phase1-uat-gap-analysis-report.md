# Phase 1 UAT Gap Analysis

This report compares the repository implementation against the Phase 1 change requests defined in [BLUEPRINT.md](../BLUEPRINT.md). Each requirement is mapped to the relevant modules with a status indicator:

- ✓ implemented
- ⚠ partial
- ✗ missing

## Identified Gaps

1. **Branch protection & policy enforcement (P1‑01 – High)**
   - Pre-commit hooks are configured, but branch protection cannot be confirmed from the repository. Documentation should outline required settings.
2. **Coverage enforcement (P1‑19 – Medium)**
   - Unit tests exist, but the CI workflow does not enforce a minimum coverage threshold.
3. **LTM API validation and RBAC (P2‑01 – High)**
   - The LTM service lacks strict validation for the `memory_type` field and endpoint-level access control.

## Recommended Remediation

- Document branch protection rules and ensure they are enforced in repository settings.
- Add a coverage check (e.g., `pytest --cov` with a minimum threshold) to the CI workflow.
- Enhance the LTM API with input validation and integrate RBAC checks.

## Review Session

A review walkthrough should cover these findings and confirm remediation plans ahead of Phase 1 UAT.
