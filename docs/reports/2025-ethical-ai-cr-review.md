# Ethical AI & Alignment Framework Change Request Review

This document reviews the six change requests outlined in the proposal _"Architecting a Dedicated Ethical AI and Alignment Framework"_. Each CR is summarized with recommendations to facilitate practical implementation.

| CR ID | Summary | Recommendation |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| **CR-EA-01** | Implement a multi-layered guardrail orchestration service as a gateway for all agent interactions. | Define a minimal HTTP API for input/output checks, start with PII masking and prompt injection detection, and log moderation decisions for auditability. |
| **CR-EA-02** | Develop a parallel "Safeguard Agent" that monitors activity and enforces the ethical constitution. | Limit the agent's authority to blocking or flagging actions and require human escalation for irreversible changes. Instrument the policy manifest for clarity. |
| **CR-EA-03** | Formalize and implement a machine-readable system constitution defining core ethical principles. | Establish an AI Safety Council to draft the constitution and store it in version control. Prioritize concise, positively framed principles. |
| **CR-EA-04** | Re-architect the reinforcement learning loop to align the reward model with the constitution (RLCAI). | Prototype with a small supervised dataset first; ensure preference labeling uses constitution-based scoring from the Safeguard Agent. |
| **CR-EA-05** | Build a continuous adversarial benchmarking pipeline with LLM-as-judge evaluation. | Automate adversarial prompt generation and track harmfulness and neutrality metrics. Validate judge scores against periodic human review. |
| **CR-EA-06** | Adopt a formal AI assurance lifecycle framework (e.g., MITRE AI Assurance). | Map evidence from CR-EA-01 through CR-EA-05 into a living assurance plan reviewed quarterly. |

Overall these requests move the system toward a defense-in-depth architecture with explicit policy enforcement. The recommended actions emphasize incremental adoption and clear audit trails to ensure each component can be tested and verified.
