---

## 🔍 Issues Resolved

### 1. **Security Vulnerabilities** 🔒
**Problem:** 2 critical vulnerabilities in dependencies causing pipeline failures
- `openai==1.3.5` - Known security issues
- Outdated dependency versions

**Solution:**
- Updated `openai` to v1.50.2 (latest security patches)
- Confirmed `torch>=2.7.1` compliance
- Enhanced vulnerability handling in CD pipeline

### 2. **Deployment Safety** 🚀
**Problem:** Basic deployment script with insufficient error handling and safety checks

**Solution:**
- Enhanced `scripts/deploy.sh` with comprehensive safety features:
  - Pre-deployment validation (environment, git status, security)
  - Blue-green deployment with automatic rollback
  - Health monitoring and validation
  - Production branch protection

### 3. **Pipeline Monitoring** 📊
**Problem:** No proactive pipeline health monitoring or alerting

**Solution:**
- Implemented `pipeline-health-monitor.yml` workflow
- Real-time performance and security monitoring
- Automated alerting for degradation
- Comprehensive weekly reporting
