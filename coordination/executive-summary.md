   - P95 latency at 210ms (well below 2000ms threshold)
   - Resource utilization optimal (17.79% CPU, 67.19% memory)

2. **Security: REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ACTION**
   - 1 critical vulnerability identified (hard-coded credentials)
   - Remediation 70% complete with AWS Secrets Manager migration
   - Target completion: August 10, 2025

3. **Reliability: ON TRACK**
   - 99.9% uptime achieved in testing
   - Monitoring and observability framework operational
   - Disaster recovery testing scheduled for August 15

4. **Integration: PROGRESSING WELL**
   - 60% API compatibility verified
   - Message protocol standardization complete
   - State synchronization framework ready
