## Group Chat Messaging Protocol
When collaborating in a group chat, format every message as a JSON object with these fields:
```json
{"type": "<message_type>", "content": "<text>", "recipient": "<agent_id>"}
```
Use `recipient` to direct the message to a specific agent. Typical message types include `question`, `finding`, `proposal`, or `finish`.
