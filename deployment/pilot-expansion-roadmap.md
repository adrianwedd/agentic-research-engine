# Pilot Expansion Roadmap - Phase 2 to Production
## Strategic Business Validation and Market Readiness Assessment

**Classification:** STRATEGIC - EXPANSION PLANNING  
**Priority:** P1-HIGH  
**Timeline:** 6-month pilot validation + 6-month expansion execution  
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM (data-driven approach)

---

## Executive Summary

This roadmap defines the strategic expansion path from Phase 2 pilot validation (50 users) to full market deployment (unlimited users), based on comprehensive business validation metrics, technical performance data, and customer success indicators. The expansion follows a data-driven approach with clear success criteria and go/no-go decision gates.

**Expansion Philosophy:** Scale only when excellence is proven, not just when capacity allows.
