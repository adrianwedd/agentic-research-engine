# ORCHESTRIX Pilot Integration Plan
## Agentic Research Engine Safe Integration Strategy

**Classification:** CRITICAL - PILOT INTEGRATION
**Timeline:** 4-week phased implementation
**Risk Level:** HIGH → MEDIUM (post-mitigation)

---

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines a secure, controlled pilot integration of the agentic-research-engine with ORCHESTRIX, implementing critical security hardening, comprehensive monitoring, and risk mitigation strategies to enable safe production evaluation.

**Key Findings from Security Audit:**
- Hard-coded API tokens in configuration (CRITICAL)
- Insufficient input validation and authentication gaps
- Missing secrets management infrastructure
- Limited network segmentation and isolation
- Inadequate monitoring for security events

---

## 1. SANDBOX ENVIRONMENT SETUP

### 1.1 Infrastructure Architecture

```yaml
# Isolated Deployment Architecture
sandbox_environment:
  network_segmentation:
    - dedicated_vpc: "orchestrix-pilot-vpc"
    - isolated_subnets: ["private-agents", "dmz-gateway", "monitoring"]
    - security_groups: ["minimal-ingress", "monitored-egress"]
  
  resource_allocation:
    compute:
      - nodes: 3 (t3.medium)
      - cpu_limits: "2 cores per service"
      - memory_limits: "4GB per service"
    storage:
      - persistent_volumes: "20GB SSD"
      - backup_retention: "7 days"
    
  kubernetes_namespace: "orchestrix-pilot"
  environment_label: "sandbox-pilot"
```

### 1.2 Security Boundaries Implementation

**Network Isolation:**
- Dedicated VPC with custom route tables
- Private subnets for agent services (no direct internet access)
- NAT Gateway for controlled egress
- Application Load Balancer in DMZ subnet

**Access Controls:**
- RBAC with least-privilege principles
- Service mesh (Istio) for encrypted inter-service communication
- mTLS certificates managed by cert-manager
- Network policies restricting pod-to-pod communication

**Data Isolation:**
- Separate database instances for pilot
- Encrypted storage with customer-managed keys
- Data residency controls and retention policies

### 1.3 Resource Limits and Quotas

```yaml
resource_quotas:
  requests.cpu: "8"
  requests.memory: "16Gi"
  limits.cpu: "12" 
  limits.memory: "24Gi"
  persistentvolumeclaims: "10"
  services: "20"
  count/ingresses: "5"

pod_security_policies:
  - no_privileged_containers
  - read_only_root_filesystem
  - run_as_non_root
  - resource_limits_enforced
```

## 2. CRITICAL SECURITY HARDENING

### 2.1 Immediate Security Fixes

**Priority 1 - Hard-coded Credentials (CRITICAL):**
```yaml
secrets_remediation:
  external_secrets_operator:
    provider: "aws-secrets-manager"
    refresh_interval: "1h"
  
  secret_mappings:
    - name: "reputation-api-keys"
      source: "orchestrix-pilot/reputation-tokens"
      type: "bearer-tokens"
    - name: "llm-api-credentials" 
      source: "orchestrix-pilot/llm-tokens"
      type: "api-keys"
    - name: "github-integration"
      source: "orchestrix-pilot/github-tokens"
      type: "oauth-tokens"
```

**Priority 2 - Authentication Hardening:**
- Implement OAuth2/OIDC with JWT validation
- Add request signing for inter-service communication
- Enable API rate limiting (100 req/min per client)
- Implement request tracing and audit logging

**Priority 3 - Input Validation Framework:**
- Pydantic schema validation for all endpoints
- JSON schema validation for configuration
- SQL injection prevention with parameterized queries
- XSS protection headers and content sanitization

### 2.2 Secure Service Communication

```yaml
service_mesh_config:
  mtls:
    mode: "STRICT"
    certificate_authority: "pilot-ca"
  
  authorization_policies:
    - service: "reputation-service"
      allowed_principals: ["evaluator", "planner"]
    - service: "episodic-memory"
      allowed_principals: ["all-agents"]
  
  network_policies:
    - ingress: "api-gateway-only"
    - egress: "database-and-monitoring"
```

### 2.3 Secrets Management Implementation

**AWS Secrets Manager Integration:**
- Automatic credential rotation every 30 days
- Encryption at rest with KMS customer-managed keys
- Fine-grained IAM policies for secret access
- Audit logging of all secret retrievals

---

## 3. INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE

### 3.1 API Gateway Integration with ORCHESTRIX

```yaml
api_gateway_config:
  ingress_controller: "nginx-ingress"
  rate_limiting:
    rpm: 1000
    burst: 50
  
  authentication:
    type: "oauth2-proxy"
    provider: "orchestrix-idp"
    
  routing_rules:
    - path: "/api/v1/research/*"
      service: "agentic-research-engine"
      auth_required: true
    - path: "/api/v1/memory/*"
      service: "episodic-memory"
      auth_required: true
      rate_limit: "100/min"
```

### 3.2 Agent Communication Protocol Adaptation

**Protocol Standardization:**
- Adopt ORCHESTRIX message format (JSON-RPC 2.0)
- Implement async message queuing with Redis
- Add message acknowledgment and retry logic
- Enable distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry

**State Synchronization:**
- Implement event sourcing for agent state changes
- Use PostgreSQL for durable state storage
- Add conflict resolution for concurrent updates
- Enable state snapshots for quick recovery

### 3.3 Monitoring and Observability Integration

```yaml
monitoring_stack:
  metrics:
    - prometheus: "orchestrix-prometheus"
    - grafana: "shared-dashboards"
    - alertmanager: "pilot-alerts"
  
  logging:
    - fluentd: "structured-logs"
    - elasticsearch: "centralized-search"
    - kibana: "log-analysis"
  
  tracing:
    - jaeger: "distributed-tracing"
    - opentelemetry: "instrumentation"
```

## 4. RISK MITIGATION STRATEGY

### 4.1 Rollback Procedures and Failure Isolation

**Blue-Green Deployment Strategy:**
```yaml
deployment_strategy:
  type: "blue-green"
  health_checks:
    - endpoint: "/health"
    - timeout: "30s"
    - failure_threshold: 3
  
  rollback_triggers:
    - error_rate: "> 5%"
    - latency_p95: "> 2s"
    - memory_usage: "> 80%"
    - failed_health_checks: "> 2"
  
  automatic_rollback: true
  rollback_timeout: "5 minutes"
```

**Circuit Breaker Implementation:**
- Hystrix-style circuit breakers for external services
- Fallback mechanisms for critical agent functions
- Graceful degradation for non-essential features

### 4.2 Data Protection and Backup Strategies

**Backup Configuration:**
```yaml
backup_strategy:
  databases:
    - postgresql: "continuous WAL archiving"
    - weaviate: "daily snapshots"
    - retention: "30 days"
  
  application_state:
    - persistent_volumes: "daily backups"
    - configuration: "versioned in git"
  
  disaster_recovery:
    - rto: "15 minutes"
    - rpo: "5 minutes"
    - cross_region_replication: true
```

### 4.3 Performance Monitoring and Circuit Breakers

**SLA Monitoring:**
- Availability: 99.5% minimum
- Response time: p95 < 2 seconds
- Error rate: < 2%
- Memory usage: < 80%

**Circuit Breaker Thresholds:**
- Failure rate: 50% over 10 requests
- Response time: > 5 seconds
- Recovery time: 30 seconds

### 4.4 Compliance and Audit Trail
